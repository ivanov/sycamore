I'm somewhat interested in helping the LocalWiki/Sycamore project, but I don't know Python and I don't know if I really have time to pick it up.  So, I was curious if you had thought of implementing a way of allowing users to change to this kind of wiki when they were running another one.  Basically, to get some scripts to convert from MediaWiki or MoinMoin syntax to DavisWiki syntax.  Since I am a Perl programmer, I could do something like this pretty easily (I [[heart]] regular expressions).  I don't think a conversion could be perfect, but it would give people a choice to change an ongoing wiki.  What do you all think? --["BrentLaabs"]

''Sounds like an awesome idea!  You can find all the regular expressions that convert wiki->html in parser/wiki.py.  Looking at them will let you know all the things you need to cover.  If you know perl, you could help out by making a script that does the bottom part of ["New image macro"].''
