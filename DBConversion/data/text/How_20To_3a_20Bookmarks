Bookmarks are an easy way to keep track of what you've already read in ["Recent Changes"].  Simply click "Update my bookmark timestamp" to set a bookmark.  Then, whenever you check ["Recent Changes"] you will see only changes ''since you last clicked Update''.  So once you've read some items and don't want to see them again, just click "Update my bookmark timestamp."  This is useful if you check ["Recent Changes"] often.
