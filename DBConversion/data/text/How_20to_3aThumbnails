Want to upload that nice, pretty, awesome photo you took, but you're bummed out that you have to shrink it down to post it in a page?  Well, just {{{[[Thumbnail]]}}} it!  Upload and image as usual (say, {{{image.jpg}}}), but then instead of using {{{attachment:image.jpg}}} you use {{{[[Thumbnail(image.jpg)]]}}}.

== Options ==
In addition, you can specify some things to make your life easier and pages prettier.  To set a size for your thumbnail, you simply add a maximum size (in pixels).  To give the image a caption, simply add a {{{"statement in quotes"}}}.  To say make the thumbnail forced to the left or to the right (it can look ''very nice'' like this sometimes), write {{{left}}} or {{{right}}}.

=== Example ===
So I upload the image as usual:

attachment:image.jpg

Then I write:

{{{[[Thumbnail(image.jpg)]]}}}

[[Thumbnail(image.jpg)]]

And what do you know?  The image is now a thumbnail.  This means if you click on it you'll see the larger version of the image.  Now lets try out some of the other options mentioned.  First lets start with a caption.  Say I want my caption to read {{{A nice view of some books}}}.  I merely write {{{[[Thumbnail(image.jpg, "A nice view of some books")]]}}}

[[Thumbnail(image.jpg, "A nice view of some books")]]

and then I get the thumbnail with a little caption in it!  Notice that the text will wrap ''around'' thumbnailed images, making them a more natural part of the page.  Now lets try the alignment options out.  Lets send the image to the right by doing {{{[[Thumbnail(image.jpg, right, "A nice..")]]}}}.

[[Thumbnail(image.jpg, right, "A nice..")]]

Now the image is sent over to the right!  And the text, as before, wraps around it.  Text will continue to wrap around these thumbails until a new section (e.g. {{{== section here ==}}}) is encountered.

= Size =
As mentioned before, just throw in a maximum size (width ''or'' height) to have it scale to that size (instead of the default).  This is good if you want to control the size of the image but also have it be ''even larger'' when you click on it!

So one example.  Say we have the following image:

attachment:newimage.jpg

Then we do {{{[[Thumbnail(newimage.jpg, 240)]]}}}.  Then that displays as:

[[Thumbnail(newimage.jpg, 240)]]

= Questions =
You might have noticed that {{{[[Thumbnail(image.jpg)]]}}} is sent to the left automatically -- yes, yes, that's true, but there is a slight difference between just the normal Thumbnail and {{{[[Thumbnail(..,left)]]}}}.  When we specify {{{left}}} or {{{right}}} that tells the wiki we want the images to stack to the left and to the right.  Here's a neat example:

Say I do {{{[[Thumbnail(image.jpg, left, "A left-view books!")]]}}}  and {{{[[Thumbnail(image.jpg, left, "A book's left-view?")]]}}}  both on the same line:

[[Thumbnail(image.jpg, left, "A left-view books!")]]  [[Thumbnail(image.jpg, left, "A book's left-view?")]]

As you can see, both images are to the left, but they are stacked on top of each other.  This is useful when you have a lot of text in an article.  This is in contrast to what would happen if we left out the {{{left}}} for that same example:

[[Thumbnail(image.jpg "A view books!")]]  [[Thumbnail(image.jpg, "A book's view?")]]

As you can see, the images are more a 'part' of the page and stick into it, as opposed to sliding down the side.  One might look better than the other -- it all depends on the page.

= Notes =
You don't have to use {{{attachment:}}} first -- you can just write {{{[[Thumbnail(someimage.jpg)]]}}} and it will ask you to upload the image as usual :)

''2005-01-31 19:57:49'' [[nbsp]] Which browsers does this work with? Safari on OS X 10.3 doesn't bring up the full image, even with blocking turned off. The cursor changes when over the image, but clicking does nothing. --["JasonAller"]------
''2005-01-31 20:27:39'' [[nbsp]] Try reloading the page and trying again.  There might have been a cache problem for your browser (But it should be fixed w/o need to reload cache now). --["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2005-01-31 20:45:13'' [[nbsp]] Try making the thumbnailed images use <A> tags with target="_window" instead of the javascript. The Javascript for popups is being disabled by my (sane) FireFox settings which disable popups. --["KenBloom"]------
''2005-01-31 20:46:18'' [[nbsp]] Also, what happens if I {{{[[Thumbnail(Someimagethathasntbeenloaded.jpg)]]}}}? Does it give me a link asking me to upload the image? [[Thumbnail(Someimagethathasntbeenloaded.jpg)]] --["KenBloom"]------
''2005-01-31 20:52:03'' [[nbsp]] As for the JS, Mike should figure that out.  But I suspect your firefox is not sane, as you might believe it to be.  Have you been watching it carefully at night?  I've seen it lurking in some strange places these last couple of weeks, and you might want to get it checked out.  But, anyway, click-triggered popups should realistically never be blocked, and my Firefox doesn't block them (Why should it?)  As for non-uploaded, yes, that's exactly what it does.  Maybe you can make it more clear? :/ --["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2005-01-31 21:00:45'' [[nbsp]] I think that FireFox's popup blocking disables javascript's openwin() function, except when called from <a href="javascript:...">, so that method or the _target method should be used to pop up new windows. --["KenBloom"]------
''2005-01-31 21:02:24'' [[nbsp]] Still not working for me with Safari, I'm also seeing something new at the top of every page, it seems that the edit helper is part of the page header now. --["JasonAller"]------
''2005-01-31 21:02:56'' [[nbsp]] ooh, now it worked. --["KenBloom"]------
''2005-01-31 21:15:00'' [[nbsp]] Ok guys, it should be working now. --["MikeIvanov"]------
''2005-02-01 02:27:18'' [[nbsp]] Mmmm - not working for me now!  --["JabberWokky"]------
''2005-02-01 02:28:49'' [[nbsp]] Was it working before?  Please try clearing your cache.  Also, what browser do you use? --["MikeIvanov"]------
''2005-02-01 06:51:55'' [[nbsp]] It is working for me now as well. Nice feature. --["JasonAller"]
