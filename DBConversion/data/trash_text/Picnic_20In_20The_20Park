Picnic in the Park is a popular summer event that complements the Wednesday night ["Farmers Market"].  It runs every Wednesday evening from 4:30 to 8:30 through October 22nd and is held in ["Central Park"].

For adults, the Picnic offers a variety of international cuisines from ["Japanese"] to ["Indian"], a beer and wine garden, as well as performances by local music artists.  Kids, on the other hand, can enjoy such activities as magicians and jugglers, the pedal-powered carousel, pony rides, bounce houses, face painting and ["Rocknasium"]'s portable climbing wall.

After dinner, shop for certified organic produce at the ["Farmers Market"] or join ["Davis Skate"] for an evening ride around town.

Picnic in the Park is a great place to include on a Wednesday night ["Good Ideas For Dates" date].
