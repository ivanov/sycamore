The ["MU Games Area" Memorial Union Games Area's] Bowling Alley is ''the'' bowling alley for ["Davis"].  This is because, well, it's the ''only'' bowling alley in the city.  The prices are cheap for all and you get a discount for showing your ["Reg Card"].

If you want to 'palm' the ball you'll need to use one of the special palming balls located next to the first lane.  This is because the wood used in the lanes is especially sensitive and the holes hitting the ground somehow cause problems if the ball's being palmed, so just pick up one of those nearly holeless balls and palm away.

If for some reason you have the desire to flee Davis and want to go bowling, ["Vacaville"] is home to a 24-hour bowling alley. (''please check hours/location'')
