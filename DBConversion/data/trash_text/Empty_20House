The empty house had nothing but a stereo in it, hence it was named 'Empty House'.  Now it has couches and a kitchen table. Also known as the house 'with the pool table'. The garage is almost a complete music studio. ["GnarToon"] likes to party at Empty House!

 * ["Canseco"] played one of their first shows in the living room.

 * ["PBUHKGHGH"] rocks blackstonergoredoomthrashpowerdeath metal daily in the garage.

Empty House is also home to ["Keith the Dog"].  He shares a room with Mike.

["BudCutino"] and ["DanMasiel"] used to live here until they were banished in what has come to be known as the "Great Cultural Revolution of '04". Screams of the innocent victims of that dark summer can still be heard in the long dark hallways of Mt. Haus.  

-jesus freaking christ! will someone finally create a page about me already?! i've been mentioned in, i dont know, like three pages and pictured on both the ["Empty House"] and ["Keith the Dog"] pages. this is ridiculous. evan ["Evan Hart"] has his own page and i've totally got more davis street cred than that guy! jeesh!  i mean, i guess i could do it myself but that strikes me as a little narcissistic.
