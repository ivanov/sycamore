Robotmedia is a national student film collective with chapters in Davis, New York, Seattle, Los Angeles, Austin and Berkeley. During the schoolyear, each chapter has a showcase once per quarter where they show the films from last quarter as well as decide on next quarter's themes. Even if you're not into film making, the showcases are the place to be. Davis showcases are typically shown in ["Chem 194"] but have been in ["Haring 2205"] as well.

Robotmedia is unique in that it's a film showcase without the same pretentious air that many associate with student films.  Anyone, absolutely anyone, can submit absolutely anything.  This has led Robotmedia to be the point of some controversy.  [http://www.californiaaggie.com/article/?id=1054 Some people] were offended by a film poking fun at ["CalPIRG"], others offended by [http://www.livejournal.com/community/microcinema_lod/8721.html different movies]. They have also recently shown a ["Senate"]-campaign music video about campus politics called "F.U.C.K. the Senate" which has shocked some people in the senate, links to which can be found on the ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"] page.  Regardless, Robotmedia has and always will be a place for anyone to show a movie.  You might see some films you don't like, but you're also sure to see a few that kick ass.
