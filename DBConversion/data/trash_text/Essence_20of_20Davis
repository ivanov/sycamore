When you smell ["Cows" cow] dung, think Essence of Davis. Not currently available in stores.

Naturally occuring in the vincinity of ["Tercero"], but on a hot summer night anywhere in town is fair game.

Excrement is not the only "Essence of Davis" there is, or ever has been. Current UCD students are clueless about this, but anyone who grew up in or has lived in Davis for more than a few years remembers the smell of tomatoes in the air in the fall, especially when the Hunt Cannery  was open for business. ["The Davis Enterprise" Enterprise] columnist Bob Dunning tries to wax poetic about the "smell of tomato soup" each September in one of his columns. 
 
Before I moved here I was under the impression that this whole town reeked of shit, but with the exception of the Tercero area that has turned out not to be the case at all. -- ["DanMasiel"]
