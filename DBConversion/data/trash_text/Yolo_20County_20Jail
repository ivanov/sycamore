Try your best not to go here.

So don't get detained for public drunkenness, don't get more than two noise violations on one night, always have your ID on you, don't ride abandoned bikes. Just don't fuck up because everyone wearing a badge at this place has no mercy for you and wants you to suffer. The ["Davis Police Department" Davis Police] are  more caring human beings by infinite degrees of magnitude than those at 2500 E. Gibson.

If you want to plead no contest to criminal charges, you can stay out of jail with the ["Yolo County Probation Work Program"]

* What do they give you to eat if you're a vegetarian? -- ["RishiTrivedi"]
  * They are required to give you nourishing food - that's it.  It's not an airline.  It's not a spa.  You are being incarcerated.  That said, there is sometimes fruit available.  Not always. -- ["JabberWokky" jw]
    * If you are vegetarian you can eat ham sandwiches because that's all they really offer. That and rotten apples. - ["RobRoy"]
