Sproul Hall is home to the departments of ["Linguistics"], ["Religious Studies"], ["Comparative Literature"], and foreign language programs.  At 9 stories, Sproul Hall towers over the rest of ["Campus"]. Until recently it was the tallest building in ["Yolo County"]. (''someone needs to use internet to find out what the tallest one is now, it won't tell me'' -- ["TravisGrathwell"]).

Sproul has an underground tunnel connecting it to ["Olson Hall"] (the lowest floor, where the computer labs are).  It is rumored that this was constructed for use by professors heading to ["Olson Hall" Olson] but it seems more logical that it was never intended for personal usage.

Though it has a very attractive and notable glass facade, the front of Sproul is practically invisible from the rest of ["Campus" campus], as it's blocked by ["Olson Hall"]. Due to it's location, the placement of the windows, and the fact you can't get on the roof, Sproul doesn't provide a perfect view of ["Campus" campus].  A better view can be found from the ["Physics and Geology"] building.

Sproul at ["Night Time" night] is a beautiful sight.

Every ["University of California"] campus, besides the one at San Francisco, has a Sproul Hall.

See ["no toad sexing in Davis"], a story about the tunnel connecting Sproul Hall to ["Olson Hall"].
