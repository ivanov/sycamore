"Gunrock" appears to be a blue psychotic whale that ["Mark Champagne" eats babies].  Other students interviewed for this article described it as "an evil trollish looking thing."  It stands in as mascot at UCD sports games, as we have yet to discover specifically what an "aggie" is.

Gunrock is named after a mustang used to breed cavalry horses at UC Davis in 1921.
