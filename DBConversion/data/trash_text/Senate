= Power Structure =
''The following 3 paragraphs reflect the composition of the senate at the beginning of Winter 2004 and is thus out-of-date.  A better, more up-to-date analysis is needed.''

Currently, six of the twelve seats are held by ["Student Focus"] senators, with ["L.E.A.D." LEAD] controlling five seats and one seat belonging to independent ["Donald Cohen-Cutler"]. This yields a [http://www.cs.unc.edu/~livingst/Banzhaf/ Banzhaf index] of 60% for ["Student Focus"], and 20% each for both ["Donald Cohen-Cutler" Cohen-Cutler] and ["L.E.A.D." LEAD], which may suggest that the power distribution in the Senate is out of tune with the preferences of the student body. Of course, this depends on one accepting Banzhaf's quantification of voting power.

After the newly elected Fall 2004 senators take their seats, ["L.E.A.D." LEAD's] share of seats will drop to four, with the leftover seat being occupied by independent ["Keith Shively"]. Ironically, far from diversifying the range of interests represented on the Senate, the replacement of a ["L.E.A.D." LEAD] seat with an independent increases ["Student Focus" Student Focus'] power index to 66.67%, while reducing that of the others to a mere 11.11%.

If you were wondering, yes, this means that each independent has as much power as the entire ["L.E.A.D." LEAD] block.

The Senate is responsible for voting on and creating bills and orders that say how ["ASUCD"] should operate.  Being a Senator is a very important job because of the sheer ''size'' of ["ASUCD"].

In order to truly understand the Senate, you'll want to look into ["Senate History"].

''
Guess what all 3 Independent Senators have in common? They are all part of a religious fraternity at UC Davis (Shively-AGO & Cohen-Cutler and Gerber – AEPi). There has to be a conspiracy there! So really, the 3 major political parties currently in the ASUCD Senate are LEAD, Focus and Religious Fraternity Caucus ''
Though this is true, all three of these Senate members have very different political views.  Cohen-Cutler is a progressive leftist, Gerber is a moderate liberal, and Shively is a social and fiscal conservative.

''How did you know that Gerber is a moderate liberal? I didnt even know that! -["Adam Gerber" Gerber]''

''I just thought it was interesting that Donnie said "this is true" to the conspiracy theory.'' - ["BrentLaabs" bl]

"call it 'The Sons of Abraham Independent Thinkers Caucus' ;-)  - ["GeorgejAndrews" GJA]

''I don't think you quite realize how close ["Alpha Epsilon Pi"] is to being a political party here on campus (at least from the list of people involved in ASUCD) -- ["KenBloom"]''

= Scandals/Corruption =

The ["ASUCD"] Senate has generated some interesting scandals recently.  These include:
  * The ["Senator Ackerman Scandal"] - theft of books by a senator
  * ["Lamargate"] - IRS investigation of illegal endorsement of political candidates
  * Fall 04':
   * ["Campaigning in Dorms Controversy"] - Campaigning in dorms by ["Student Focus"]
   * ["Election Statement Controversy" Elections Committee modifying candidates' statements.]

  * It is documented that some past members of the ["ASUCD"] Senate were invited to join the ranks of the secretive organization known as ["Sword and Sandals"].  It is unknown who in the Senate (if anyone) is currently a member, due to the secrecy of the organization.

= Election Information = 
The ["Elections Committee"] is responsible for elections matters.  The Senate is elected using the ["Choice Voting"] method.
 * Petitions to run for office are first available this Wednesday  (1/26) 1-3 PM on the third floor of the ["Memorial Union" MU]; they are due about a week later with at least 125 signatures.
 * The results for the 2004 election can be found in a [https://elections.ucdavis.edu/resultsf04/Fall%202004%20Round.htm hidden corner of the elections site].
 * The ["Davis College Green Party"] provides the [http://ucdgreens.org/ballotdata/fall2004.raw.txt raw data], along with other [http://ucdgreens.org/ballotdata/ senate election results], so you can rerun as many fantasy elections as you like.  It may be pertinent if some candidates are eliminated due to ["Campaigning in Dorms Controversy" campaigning in the dorms]. Software to run the election using ["Choice Voting"] is available [http://stv.sourceforge.net/ here].
 * The next election will be held on February 23-24, and there will be 8 seats open instead of the usual 6 due to the [#resignations resignations].  We will get two new ["Kalen Gallagher" Kalen] appointees in the meantime, as indicated by Chapter 2, section 11, subsection 2 of the [http://asucd.ucdavis.edu/gov/docs/ ASUCD Constitution].
