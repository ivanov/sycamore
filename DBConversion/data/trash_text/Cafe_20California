The humble white doors conceal a suprisingly open and roomy dining area, decked with local artwork.  Filled with fancy meals, the Cafe California's menu contains things like Cajun Style Pork Ribs and New York Steak, with prices ranging from $8.95 to $21-ish for the main course alone.  Most of their salads and deserts contain at least one edible flower.  They only play jazz.
