Living in Davis can be expensive, because living in such a "boring" town causes people do to a lot of online shopping.  Oh, and there's also expensive rent.  And so, in order to help stretch those checks, Davis has a few good values, just to help keep us vertical.  Perversely, sometimes the cheap stuff is better than the expensive stuff.  And there are also ways to avoid spending so much money as well.

''2004-11-21 11:48:15'' [[nbsp]] Somehow, I feel something is wrong with the idea behind this page. If you want to live cheap, don't buy as much. Every single thing on the page though is about spending money. Maybe, I'll link to parks and games and stuff when I have time. - ["JackHaskel"]------
''2004-11-21 12:18:23'' [[nbsp]] I like that idea.  Also, though, sometimes you really do need to buy food, clothes, etc, and places like Costco are usually cheaper.  Shopping ''wiser'' overall -- spending less, buying less -- is a better idea, for sure.  Maybe we could have some links to like inexpensive foods and inexpensive recipes?   - ["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2004-11-21 12:21:19'' [[nbsp]] Or maybe more of a guide to spending less while in Davis would be useful -- maybe it should go here and then from here we link to this place (maybe named "Buying stuff for less" or something) - ["PhilipNeustrom"]

''2004-11-24 18:55:24'' [[nbsp]] The falacy at work here is that people who buy things from Costco buy stuff they don't need.  I think that may be true of most Costco shoppers, but many of us Davisites prefer Costco because they sell larger sizes and therefore less packaging per oz of product (i.e., better for the environment)--and AT A LOWER COST.  The Costco parking lot is filled with Davis vehicles, so obviously the soccer moms know about this place.  Too bad there's fuel involved, but hey, you gotta do what you gotta do.  I don't know if anyone has ever figured out how much money you can save by buying necessities outside Davis, but I'm fairly certainly you can stretch a dollar twice as far.  Here's the sad thing, most of the stores in Davis sell useless, overpriced TRINKETS--which is where most of the anti-costco people think we should be shopping instead.  I wonder if the Davis city counsel realized that Cost Plus may eventually drive all those tricket dealers out of business.  I also love the co-op, but I think they have become somewhat lazy in trying to get their members the best deals, because people are willing to buy products with a very high base cost (despite their professedly low markup), while you can get the same products for much less elsewhere.  Take for example Tom's of Maine products, way too pricey.  Bottom line, at Costco, I can get a 5 pound bag of tortilla chips for $3, I can get 16 eggs for $1, and they have a modest selection of organic veggies for WAY less.  But hey, I suppose if you want to avoid buying things, you could always make your own soap.  Fight club, anyone?  - ["JaimeRaba"]

''2004-12-02 10:10:05'' [[nbsp]] Costco can be cheap for large groups of people trying to live cheaply together.  An apartment of 6 guys can get a whole lot of paper towels, soda, laundry detergent, etc, for much cheaper. - ["RohiniJasavala"]

''2004-12-12 18:59:36'' [[nbsp]] I added the big box stores walmart and target. Both are generally good with prices, however I find both carry lower-quality items (you get what you pay for). Best to buy things from these stores where they can't really mess up the quality (packaged foods, etc). - ["JamesDawe"]

''2005-02-01 21:03:01'' [[nbsp]] I hear tell the target in woodland is packing up shop. Does anyone have an ETA on this? --["ArlenAbraham"]
