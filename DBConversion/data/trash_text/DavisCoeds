Created by ["ScottBiggart"] and Tim Carson (he has a [http://www.timxdrama.com site with erotic pictures]) during the summer of 2002, DavisCoeds is a social profile site.  Like many sites created in the image of [http://www.friendster.com Friendster][EDIT: Friendster and DavisCoeds.com went public within a month of each other], [http://www.daviscoeds.com DavisCoeds] allows for a profile (for listing interests and other things) and a set of pictures for each member.  Unlike [http://www.friendster.com Friendster] or [http://www.thefacebook.com The Facebook], popular social-networking sites, the aim of Coeds isn't to weave an electronic social network -- hence there is no "friends" list.

One could say that the purpose of [http://www.daviscoeds.com DavisCoeds] is just to put up some pictures and meet people.  Most use it to meet people; a few use it to try and hook up with girls in the creepiest way possible; ["ScottBiggart" Scott] uses it as a pool of Freshman girls to make out with -- I think he's made out with... 90% of the girls on that site and god only knows how many guys.
