NIMBY stands for "Not in my backyard".

NIMBY's role in Davis ranged from when you want to have your party without violating the noise ordinance, up to the town rejecting the University proposal to get a BioSafety Lab (BSL4). NIMBY isn't unique to Davis, but it is practiced here like a religion. Any discussion of growth (including more housing for students) will feature NIMBY vocally, and sometimes violently. A public forum held at Emerson Junior High on the University proposal for a West Campus Community devolved into a minor brawl.

Davis is unique. Look at how often the sidewalk comes to an end in Davis and compare that to most other communities. The fact that the sidewalk rarely ends in town is due to slow heavily controlled growth. Industrial and major retail development have been tightly zoned.

Partly this is due to people moving here because it is a nice small town, and then fighting to keep it that way. Sometimes this results in arguments being divided by how long a person has lived in town. Student's do get short changed by this sometimes, but so do residents. The thing to keep in mind is that both sides of these arguments usually believe that they are acting in the better interest of the town.
