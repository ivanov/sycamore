These days, the Jewish Student Union is the umbrella organization for all of the ["Judaism" Jewish] student-run clubs (but not ["Chabad of Davis" Chabad] or ["Hillel House" Hillel]).

The Jewish Student Union leadership consists of the Executive Board and the General Board.

The Executive Board Members are:
 * President -- Netta Grutman
 * Vice President -- ["Adam Gerber"]
 * Secretary -- April Zonnis
 * Treasurer -- ["Daniel Stone"]
 * VP, Religious -- Sasha Kluger
 * VP, Programming -- Becca Blatt
 * VP, Publicity -- Eliana Monti

The general board is made up of representatives of each of the ["Judaism" Jewish clubs].

There is ["Kibbutz Haverim"], the Jewish Student Union co-op, which is vaguely attached to them (because of the internal structure of the Jewish Student Union, it runs largely independantly).

The Jewish Student Union runs ["Jewish Culture Week"] every year.

=== History ===
The Jewish Student Union (JSU) was closely associated with ["Hillel House"]  until the two split in the early 1990s. After the split, JSU tried to be the be-all/end-all of the ["Judaism" Jewish community] in Davis. Soon, an active female contingent saw the need for a Jewish sorority so ["Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi"] was founded. The late 1990s saw the further fragmentation of the ["Judaism" Jewish community] in to many different groups. JSU eventually found that its niche was in social programming. A group named JSAC was created to coordinate all of these groups, and in 2003 it was reorganized and merged with the JSU to create the JSU that we know today.
