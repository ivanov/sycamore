If a woman would like to see the subject matter of Rob's work change then she should throw herself at him in order to better the literary world."  Sharon changed the world. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]------

''2004-12-07 02:25:57'' [[nbsp]] Sharon is by far the most beautiful woman on earth. As I type this she is sleeping with her mouth open and a piece of lint dangling in her hair - but even then, she is still ridiculously beautiful. I know I'm sappy but I'm in love, so sue me. - ["RobRoy"]
