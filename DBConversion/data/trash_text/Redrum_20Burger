Redrum Burger ''used'' to be called ["Murder Burger"].  If you like meat, you should check out Redrum Burger.

As for the name change (from the much better ''Murder Burger''), this is what the Redrum Burger menu has to say about it:[[BR]]''...responding to customer comments primarily from (the Former Rocklin location), they decided it was time to change the restaurant's name.  They chose the democratic route, deciding to let customers choose the new name...technically the winner was "Murder Burger," but the owners had committed to a name change.  "Redrum Burger" was the second most popular choice, and thus was selected.''

The other popular story of the name change is that the old owners would sell the establishment but wanted an excessive amount of money for the rights to the name "Murder Burger."  This could be why the establishment was so ''committed'' to a name change.
 * ''Reliable sources have told me the same thing. New owners couldn't use the old name without a stiff fee, and the switch was a bit of a slap in the seller's face. - ["KenNeville"]


One truly amazing item they sell is the ZOOM.  Yes, ZOOM.  It stands for '''''Z'''''ucchini '''''O'''''ni'''''o'''''n Rings and '''''M'''''ushrooms.  All heavily breaded and then deep fried.  Can you feel your heart tensing at the thought of that onslaught of healthy stuff?  If you do get a ZOOM, don't plan on finishing anything you order, this thing is HUGE.
