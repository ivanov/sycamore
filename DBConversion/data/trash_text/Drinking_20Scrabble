This game is best played with small sips and cheap beer, like PBR.

Play Scrabble as normal. After each round add up everbody's points, the players with the least points must take a sip of beer for each point difference between themselves and the person with the most points. Repeat. Enjoy the arguments for admission of nonsensical words.
