They close at 10PM during the week.  I think this is important to know because I often forget.  I'll research their full hours more later.

The best things on the menu are the popcorn chicken and the BBQ Chicken Sandwich, I believe it is called.

But most importantly, they close at 10PM.  which really sucks.

''It might be just me, but I find their wraps delicious.'' - ["AndreyGoder"]

''Back in the day, they used to offer free popcorn chicken as a promotion. Keep your eyes open for this, as my buddies and i used to exploit it left and right'' - ["DerekTam"]

''Pretty good for a KFC. It's relatively clean and well run and the food is adequate. I prefer extra crispy to original recipe.
Check the mail for coupons they send, it will save you money. Furthermore, they don't usually collect the coupons when you use them, so you can reuse them as long as they haven't expired.
The next closest fast food fried chicken is the Popeye's in Dixon.'' -- ["AndrewMatey"]
