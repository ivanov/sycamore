= The Dark Lair Of Paul Lanzi =
attachment:paul_pic.jpg

Right.. what better place to screw up Phil's new wiki than to start with my own page?

I'm a somewhat/kinda recent graduate from the Computer Science Department of the College of Letters and Science at the University of California at Davis.  I am currently a corporate slave for a large telecommunications company where I spend my days managing projects, the invigorating nature of which can only be described as 'non-existant'.

''But you already knew all that.''

What you don't know is that in my next life, I plan on being a wombat.

''07/23/2004 01:19:48 AM'' Paul, if you'd like to work on the CSS, I suggest getting the "Web Developer" extension for Firefox, which allows you to edit the CSS as you view it, then save and upload it.  The things we still want to finalize are the fonts and colors.  They look nice, but still the fonts are borrowed from the old theme, and if there's something better we'd like to see it.  You can also edit the "formbutton" style, which will be applied to all the buttons(right now it's applied only to the buttons on the edit page.)  That extension makes it very easy to edit stuff and see how it looks immediately. - ["MikeIvanov"]

''07/28/2004 12:29:58 AM'' Yep.  Have had the Web Developer extension installed for some time.  It certainly rocks!  I'm going to brainstorm on some color schemes soon and run them by you guys. - ["PaulLanzi"]------
''2004-07-28 01:21:29'' [[nbsp]] That would be very cool.  I have made the logo transparent, so you can actually change the banner colors to be something off-black.  Also, Philip did an awesome job on the Comments macro, and if you want to put "Your chance to object" in there, you can use Comments(Your chance to object).  ["Events Board"] and a new ["Davis Map"] are in the works! - ["MikeIvanov"]

''2004-10-21 23:22:14'' [[nbsp]] What symbols do we need to add to the allowed symbols list?  There are a couple that would cause trouble, and I need to check to see which they are. .  - ["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2004-10-21 23:30:25'' [[nbsp]] probably need both '?' and an apostrophe... but it occurs to me that those might be the precise symbols that would cause problems... - ["PaulLanzi"]

''2004-10-27 01:23:13'' [[nbsp]] Hey Paul, to add points you go into Edit for the page.  There's an "Edit Map" button.  It's all documented in ["Davis Wiki Guide"]. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2004-10-27 01:55:53'' [[nbsp]] (Was it unclear in the guide or did you not re-read it?  Is the Edit area the wrong area for that?) - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
