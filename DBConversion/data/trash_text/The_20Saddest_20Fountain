Camping in front of ["Dutton Hall"], this presumably nameless fountain is henceforth given the name The Saddest Fountain, for it can only barely pass as a fountain at all.

When you pass by it looks just like a hump coming out from the ground, with no water flowing at all.  The fountain is calibrated to pump out just enough water so that it trickles slowly down the side of the slightly pointed hump.

People occasionally add soap to the fountain.  Please don't do that.


Another popular name for this fountain among other students who find joy in sweet foods is "Flan Fountain" because it looks like a giant mound of flan protruding from the ground. Except for the pesky rocks that reside inside. 

''When I'm trying to direct students and parents to our office (yes, I work in the Evil ["Dutton Hall"]), I tell them to look for the 3 foot glass fronted building with the fountain in front that looks like a margarine tub.'' - ["AnitaNalley"]
