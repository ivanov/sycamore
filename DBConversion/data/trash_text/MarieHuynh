Marie Huynh did not start life as a ["BarnabasTruman" cat], but may end up as one.  She hates walking behind smokers and is amused by the thought of dressing up and walking around with a bow and arrows tipped with nicotine.  Lucky for them, she too cheap to buy such things.  Still, she has no qualms about diving into a dumpster if it would result in her acquiring such things.  

stuff:

 * major: Computer Engineering 
 * minor(s): possibly Cultural Anthropology(because there's no Anthro Linguistics minor AFAIK)
  * Logic (in the Philosophy department)
 * year: 4th and counting
 * hobbies: origami, thinking about silly things (and people)
 * lives at ["1529-4"] 
 * ran for ["ASUCD"] ["Senate"] with ["SOSSS"] in Fall 20004
 * made the keys of her keyboard spell out her full name and jumbled some of the other letters so nobody else can use her pooter
 * forgets things when nervous

Current things:

 * ["Yev"] + dwarf hamsters
 * programming for ["Micromouse"] group
 * volunteering at ["Craft Center"]
 * ["buying souls"]
 * amusing self by creating ["Wanted Pages"]
 * owes someone a ["nalgene bottle"]
 * organizing life
 * looking for cheap bulk film to do photography
