Movies. We've probably all seen several. Many of us see more than one a week: in a ["Movie Theaters" theater] if you've got lots of cash, or from the ["49er Video" rental place] if you don't.

''It would be great it people could list and rate some of their (most/least) favorite movies here.  This is a place to talk about somewhat current movies you've seen (video or theater).  If we put what we've recently enjoyed, then other people can make use of this in deciding whether to go rent/go see a film (especially useful for the indie ["Movie Theaters" theaters] in Sac).''

'''Drama'''
 * ''American Splendor'': I don't know if this should maybe get filed under documentary instead, but I'll put it here for now. I just finished watching this, and I was quite pleased. It got a lot of critical hype, so I was a bit wary, but it was actually really good. It's the story of Harvey Pekar, the writer behind the American Splendor series of graphic novels. Basically, Harvey is a normal, if somewhat gloomy, guy, who has quite a knack for capturing real life in his stories. The things that are so remarkable about the film is how well the actors manage to capture the real feel of the characters they are portraying, and how human, yet likable, the characters are. I often don't like movies that are manufactured to make me feel happy, but this movie did it despite itself, which is a rather nice accomplishment. I don't know, this probably sounds a bit rambling, but this is just a really interesting, well made movie. Definitely worth renting. -["EricKlein"]
 * ''Life as a House'': Currently my favorite film. I think this is just an extremely well made movie. Although it does have Hayden Christianson doing his teen angst thing, it actually works better here than it does in certain other movies. This is the story of a man (played by Kevin Kline) who lives alone in a run-down old house. He loses his job, and soon finds that he has terminal cancer. This brings his life into rather sharp focus, and he decides to finally get his act together somewhat. He gets back into his sons life, and tries to both be a real father, and get to know his son. He also starts making other human connections as well, including getting back on good terms with his ex-wife. The thing that makes this movie so good is again its humanity. The character writing for this movie was really well done, and it really makes you feel for the characters and what they are all going through. If you haven't seen this movie, I can't recommend it highly enough. -["EricKlein"]
 * I recently saw "[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120263/ Songs from the Second Story]" and I enjoyed it a lot.  It was a completely surreal Swedish film and like nothing I had seen before (and I end up seeing a lot of weird movies).  The camera movies only once during a shot and the cinematography is incredible.  The film revolves around this corporation and its efforts to survive during an economic meltdown -- roughly.  Very good and very hard to describe, but I promise you haven't seen a movie like this before (or, well, maybe you have, who knows). -["PhilipNeustrom"]
 * May as well add [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168629/ Dancer in the Dark] to this list. I'm a huge [http://www.bjork.com Björk] fan, but I think anyone who appreciates a good movie will like this film. Not much of a date movie, but absolutely exudes emotion. - ["KenNeville"]

'''Action'''

'''Comedy'''
  * The three Christopher Guest films, ''Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show'' and ''A Mighty Wind.''  The same crew of actors in vastly differing roles, each hilarious in its parody of a certain slice of life.  You'll never watch a dog show the same way again after seeing ''Best in Show.''  Anyone involved in theatre will recognize '''all''' the characters in ''Waiting for Guffman.''  As for ''A Mighty Wind,'' anybody who lived through the sixties or who has seen any of the PBS specials featuring the folk singers of that era will laugh at this movie. --["BevSykes"]

'''Sci Fi'''

'''Horror'''

'''Fantasy'''
 * ''Lord of the Rings Series'': Spectacular. Peter Jackson did a truly remarkable job of bringing the books to the big screen, without resorting to making a 30 hour monstrosity (-cough- Shogun -cough-). The movies are quite fun to watch, and yet people who are really into the whole Tolkien thing are also generally quite pleased with the quality of the movies as well. Sure, some parts of the books were left out, but not really anything massively important. Unless you consider an ancient Gnome-like man who sings nonsensical rhymes to wizened trees massively important, they you are in for a disappointment. Definitely the best epic film series of the last decade. -["EricKlein"]

'''Romance'''

'''Anime'''
 * Recently watched ''Dead Leaves'' by Production I.G.  It's amazing.  Like someone decided FLCL was too ''slow-paced''.  Oozes style.  Loads of fun, highly-recommended. --["ChrisTakemura" ct]
 * I'm obsessed with ''Naruto''. I watched 50 episodes in a week. You can't beat cool-looking ninjas and flashy colors. - ["KennyOrtiz"]
