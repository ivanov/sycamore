[[BR]][[BR]]'''Description:''' I called this phone in August 2003 when I was in Orlando, and had a nice conversation with someone on the street who happened to be eating dinner with Ingrid Salim, a teacher at ["Holmes Junior High School"]. I've called it a few other times too, receiving mixed reactions. It's not hard to get someone to pick up, though, since it's such a busy area. - ["GrahamKolbeins"][[BR]][[BR]]'''Charge:''' 50 cents for a local call.||
