''Weed'' usually refers to marijuana. It is pretty easy to get in Davis, thanks to a solid base of college students, Brushfire Collective fans, and ["Night Time" late-night food options]. There is one ["Dead Zone Novelties" head shop] in Davis these days, but you can buy hemp products all over town and obviously the ["Whole Earth Festival"] causes a cloud to descend on the city.   Folks that smoke a ton of weed are commonly refered to as ["Potheads"].
