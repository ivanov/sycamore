This is a listing of closed ["Bike Paths" bike paths] because of ["University Construction" University construction] and the best alternate routes to take to get around them.

  * '''["Cuarto"] to ["Campus"]''' - The bike path used to go south of ["Segundo"]. Due to construction of the new ["Segundo Dining Commons"] on the spot that this bike path used to occupy, the path has been re-routed north through Segundo for the duration of the construction. It takes a little longer, but it's still generally the best way through.

  * '''["Cuarto"] to ["Kemper Hall" Kemper]''' - The bike path which runs north-south located between the Rec Hall and the police station is closed due to the construction of a parking garage.
      * One alternate route is to take the bike path down La Rue to Hutchison, cross at the traffic light and continue on the bike path on Hutchison. You'll have to do a nasty dodge to get across the street at an area where there's no stop sign. Then continue riding on the right side of the street. This is probably faster than the other.
      * Another alternative is to go through Segundo, past the student housing office, then straight south past Kleiber and right across the front of Sciences Laboratory Building 123. Continue down Bioletti.
