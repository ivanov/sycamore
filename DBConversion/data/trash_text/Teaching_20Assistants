You know them as TAs. They are the ["Grad Students"] who grade your papers, run your labs, and lead your discussion sections. Advanced TAs (or AIs, Associate Instructors) may even teach their own classes. For instance, most English 1 and English 3 courses at ["Campus" UCD] are taught by graduate student instructors.
