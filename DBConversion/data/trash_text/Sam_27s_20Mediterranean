Sam's offers the best Falafel in Davis, and really friendly employees.

On Mondays, if you order a Falafel you get a free soft drink.  This is an incredible thing and should not be missed.

On the walls inside Sam's is a painting of a Mediterranean countryside.

Sam's is a block away from ["Ali Baba"]'s, which is also on 3rd street -- offering similar food.  Some swear by Sam's, some by ["Ali Baba"].

''2004-11-12 11:43:33'' [[nbsp]] Even though the specialty is mediterranean food, Sam's has some of the best cheeseburgers in town. - ["TheRadish"]

''2004-11-12 21:13:55'' [[nbsp]] Although, the funny thing is that Ali Baba's also has some damn good burgers.  But I like Sam's too.  I like that Sam's is more of a family enterprise and Ali Baba is more about hiring other people to cook.  Both have their moments. - ["JaimeRaba"]

''2004-11-15 00:24:19'' [[nbsp]] If you are of a politcal slant, you should know that Sam's financially supported and hosted meetings of the "Free Palestine" group on campus.  This group publically called for the destruction of the Israeli state.  I don't know if they're still active, but it's reason enough for me to choose Ali Baba's over Sam's.  Your political motivations may vary. - ["PaulLanzi"]------
''2004-11-15 19:04:43'' [[nbsp]] well, hey, that does kind of suck.  But some minor contribution to some minor group seems .. well, pretty minor, no matter how outlandish their claim.  Look at all the shit that McDonalds does in the world.  And hey, we just found out that Harvard bsaically activally allowed Nazi leaders and politicians to speak.  I mean, I somehow don't think that SAM'S has called for the destruction of Israel.  Let's hope, anyway. - ["JaimeRaba"]------
''2004-11-15 20:38:10'' [[nbsp]] If you want crunchier falafels with onion, go to ["Ali Baba"].  Otherwise, Sam's is great. - ["MarieHuynh"]------
''2004-11-15 21:44:42'' [[nbsp]] I don't see what's wrong with allowing Nazi leaders and politicians to speak.  What's the point of freedom of speech if it only applies to ideas that don't offend you? - ["KenjiYamada"]------
''2004-11-15 22:02:59'' [[nbsp]] I thought this page was about falafel?  Seriously, though, I don't think it's worth speculating whether Sam's Mediterranean Cuisine, as a business, endorses or endorsed the aforementioned group's message. - ["MikeIvanov"]
