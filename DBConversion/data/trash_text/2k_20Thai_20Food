One of Davis' newer (and arguably better) Thai food restaurants. When it first came to Davis, it was reasonably trashy with linoleum floors and fluorescent lighting, but has since made drastic renovations making it one of the nicer restaurants in Davis.  The backs of the new menus explain the origin of 2k Thai Food's mysterious name.

Also, they have Thai iced tea with black pearls!  Yummy!


 ''-This is the best Thai food in davis. Hands down. Or up. Whatever you do with your hands, it's still the best Thai. The owner is a very nice lady, and after having some conversations with her I could definately tell that they cook with love here. Thai cooking with love. You can't beat that man. Ya' can't, ya' can't, ya' can't.'' - ["MikeKayton"]

 ''-Bah! ["Thai Bistro"] is MUCH better. I'll agree though that 2k has the best "generic" Thai food in town.''- ["JackHaskel"]

 ''-No way, this is the worst Thai food in Davis. Their food resembles what ["Sodexho"] serves at the Dining Commons in the dorms and likes to call Pad Thai! The service is horrible and the waiters are consistently forgetful. If you want to eat decent Thai food try ["Thai Bistro"] or try ["Thai Recipes"] if you are a vegetarian.'' - ["AbbyLawson"]

'' -As I noted on the Thai Bistro page, I think this gets down to a taste preference issue. Some Thai restaurants sweeten their food, some don't. This one doesn't. I think the food is great.''-- ["TomHinds"]

''I can't stand the suspense!!  What's the origin of the name?'' -- ["JabberWokky"]
