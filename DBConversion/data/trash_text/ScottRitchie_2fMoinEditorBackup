Nova is a three story dorm in ["Regan Residence Halls" Regan Hall].

Nova is a theme dorm that is populated by ["Davis Honors Challenge" Davis Honors Challenge] students.  Frequently, more Honors Challenge students ask to live in Nova than there is actual space available.

There is only one bathroom per floor, so typically the first and third floors will be women's bathrooms while the second will be men's.  There is also a one person guest bathroom near the lounge that men on the first floor tend to use.  If you are a woman who lives across the men's bathroom you will become instantly popular.
