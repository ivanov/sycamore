If, like most people, you grew up in a community with an open container ordinance, you probably grew up assuming that drinking in public was illegal by default. If you moved to Davis before summer 2002, you may have experienced the pleasant sensation of having that assumption fixed.  Lacking such an ordinance, Davisites were free to carry open beverages willy nilly along their sidewalks parks and streets, supping them with a relaxed and civilized air.

This pleasant, mature and dignified state came to an end when Davis ["City Council"], targeting "the problems associated with the consumption of alcoholic beverages in public, including vandalism, violence, litter, trespassing, graffiti and drug activity", passed ordinance 2084 on June 12 2002, while most students were away on summer break.  The ordinance created Municipal Code [http://www.city.davis.ca.us/cmo/citycode/chapter.cfm?chapter=26 article 26].04, the "open container" article.  There may or may not have been evidence offered to council that the article would have the intended anti-badness effect. It's unclear if anyone actually got off their ass and went to the relevant council meetings to find out, proving once again that the world is run by the people who show up.  What is certain is that Davis police department had access to all the usual "drunk in public", trespassing, vandalism etc. laws needed to apprehend anyone actually abusing their public freedom before any new ordinance was passed.

T.E. Elliot may have had an [http://www.interversity.org/lists/ncte-talk/archives/oct99/msg00351.html opinion].

The original ordinance included a 2 year sunset clause. In 2004 Davis ["City Council"], ever vigilant, reviewed the expiring bylaw and found that it had succeeded in reducing vandalism, violence, litter etc.  Again, it is unknown to the author what evidence was available to support or refute this conclusion. They passed [http://www.city.davis.ca.us/cmo/pdfs/Ord2159.pdf ordinance 2159] renewing and revising the open container rule.  A user friendly guide to the result is published [http://www.city.davis.ca.us/cmo/oco.cfm here] (for instance, you are free to have a beer at the ["Farmers Market" farmer's market], as long as they remembered to apply for a permit that week).  

Interestingly, article 26.04 does not completely forbid open containers in all public spaces.  Rather, "you are allowed to have open containers of alcohol in parks and greenbelts that do not fall into one of the above categories".  There are a lot of "above categories", for example the offlimiting of all areas within 600 feet of a public school.  Some helpful maps of specific off limits areas are provided.  Helpful maps of acceptable areas are not.

Is there anyone out there with the time and will to interpret the new rules and create maps of places where Davisites can still enjoy a quiet Sierra Nevada in their public space?


= Parks that appear allow open containers =

'''Do not trust this to be correct. I take no liability if you get cited -- ["KenBloom"]'''
  * ["Chestnut Park"]
  * ["College Park"]
  * ["Covell Park"]
  * ["Hacienda Park"]
  * ["La Playa Park"]
  * ["Mace Ranch Park"]
  * ["N Street Park"]
  * ["Northstar Park"]

  * ["Manor Park or Slide Hill Park"] 
  * ["Village Park"]

This may be a conservative estimate. (Some parks not listed may have very remote reaches that allow open containers).
