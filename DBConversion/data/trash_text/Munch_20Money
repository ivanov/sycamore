'''Munch Money''' is money that you can only use at [http://sodexho.ucdavis.edu/ Sodexho] establishments on the UC Davis campus... it's kinda like buying pre-paid phone minutes or a gift card. Upside is that you don't end up having to pay sales tax on any purchases made with the card, but the downside is that your hard-earned money is basically locked up with Sodexho. If you're thinking about purchasing Munch Money, be sure to find out if it 'expires'! Munch Money can be purchased through the Sodexho office in the Segundo Dining Commons building.
