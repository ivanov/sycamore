Vicki Swett is the Advisor of the ["ASUCD"]. Her Office coordinates with various other entities that are in the ["ASUCD"] those among them include the different commissions and committees as well as the ASUCD ["Senate"], Executive, and Judicial branches. She is actually a sweet lady but once you are her bad side she gives you the icy stare of death and can try to destroy you with it. Her blond stylized hair reminds us of the 1980&#8217;s and its wild haircuts of yesteryear. She lives in her office on the third floor of the MU next the ["SGAO"]. She is often seen with ["Mark Champagne"] lunching in the ["Memorial Union" MU] ["Coffee House"] talking about floss. 

She is retiring in December of 2004, and ASUCD is currently looking for a replacement.  She has served the ASUCD for 31 years.  This will allow ASUCD to set a new path in the future, as the student government advisor has a huge amount of influence over their years in the job.

Vicki has many supporters, as exemplified in Senate Resolution #5 (not online yet, passed 12/2/2004), which praised her years of service and passed without objection.  She also has quite a few detractors, who call her the "[http://www.livejournal.com/users/emosnail/77347.html manifestation of all that is evil]". And some people even call her an "uber troll," while others have been yelled at by her for saying "she doesn't care or understand."

Incidently, the position of "ASUCD Advisor" or even ["SGAO"] of which she is the head, have "Administrative Plans."  Administrative Plans describe the function, responsibilities and duties of every unit in ASUCD, and Government Codes Chapter Four is devoted to them.  Every ASUCD unit must have one according to the first paragraph of that chapter.  Not only that, but Vicki does not appear anywhere else in the bylaws, except where things need her approval in the Elections Codes (interestingly, she directly oversees the writing of most elections codes).  Basically, there does not currently exist any description of her intended duties, responsibilities, or limits.

''When I was underwriting director of ["KDVS"] I had to deal with her. I always thought she was cunty. The university still owes me money becuase of her. And if there is one thing I hate it is a bitch who owes me money. - ["RobRoy"]
