Easily the BEST fish tacos I've ever had, and I've had a lot. I bike to Winters once a week, just to have the fish tacos here. No fried fish,
cabbage or white sauce to be found here. Just well seasoned fish, with good salsa, excellent corn tortillas, avocado, lettuce, and a little lime. Clearly
there's more to it, but those are the highlights.

My wife loves the cheese enchiladas, and is always willing to drive out to Winters for them. My biking friends love the weekend
6 tacos for $6 deal (no fish or shrimp :)

This restaurant honestly has the best food I eat each week, and the family who run the place are all quite friendly.
