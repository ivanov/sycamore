Brent Laabs is a first year graduate student in ["Atmospheric Science"].  He has tons of titles:  MiniLuv for ["Students for an Orwellian Society"]; Campaign Manager for ["SOSSS"] and ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"], President of ["Lutheran Student Movement"] at ["The Belfry"], President of the ["AMS Club"], honorary member of ["Davis Players Society" DPS] (not really), and Discordian Pope.
