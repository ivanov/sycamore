GameStop sells new and used video games; the store also has a rack of used DVDs. You can trade in movies or games for store credit (that's how they get their used stuff).

You can also get a discount card for 10% off used games/DVDs by subscribing to Game Informer Magazine ($10 for 10 issues). However, sales tax negates most of it so it ends up being around 3% off, almost the same as without it.
