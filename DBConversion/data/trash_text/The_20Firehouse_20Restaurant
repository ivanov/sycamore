Dressy for Sacramento.  Good food, but very pricey.  Drinks are priced about the same as ["Sophia's Thai Kitchen" Sophia's] at their bar.  If you plan to eat here, try the Sacramento ["Entertainment Book"] which has a 2-for-1 card for this place.  Expect to spent between $50-100 for two people otherwise.
