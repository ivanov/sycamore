Yolo County is primarily composed of the four cities of ["Front Page" Davis], ["Woodland"], ["West Sacramento"] and ["Winters"].   Other than these cities, most of the land is used for agriculture.  Davis rests in the southwestern edge of Yolo on its border with ["Solano County"].

["Woodland"] is the county seat.
