Davis being such a small town has reoccurring characters that we all see but have little knowledge about. But if you make a reference to the person it is most likely that the person you are talking to has seen the town character.


 * ["Brian Campbell"], the guy who lives in the ["Human Powered Housing Project"]
 * ["Joe Sherman" Crazy Joe Sherman]
 * ["Hugging Guy"]
 * ["Ku Klux Klown"]
 * The ["Old Guys at the MU"]
 * ["Midget Cop"]
 * ["Scooter Man"]
 * ["Two-Step"]
 * ["Visor Lady"]
 * ["Von Howard"]
 * ["Yelling Preacher on the Quad"]

i know of a great character, but i dont know his name or what he does. It's that old guy that hangs out with the band-uh. I saw him also working at the DC. Who is he? He is a classic character. Or is he covered in one of these other characters...and i just dont see it? - ["GeorgejAndrews"]
