Wok'n'Roll serves what is, quite possibly, the worst ["Chinese Food" chinese food] known to man.  From overcooked (to the point of crunchiness) rice to fishy-tasting kung pao chicken, this is a restaurant you will likely eat at once... or never, if you heed this warning.  Just about the only good thing available is the garlic chicken.

On, the other hand, it's extremely popular.  And around lunch-time the food is still fresh and not too destroyed by heat lamps.

It is extremely cheap, too.

Their hot n' sour soup is a pretty good snack for just walking around Davis at around 79 cents.  Also good is their potstickers, which they make for you on request, thus avoiding the heatlamp problem.  The folks who run the place are really nice. - ["JaimeRaba" jr]
