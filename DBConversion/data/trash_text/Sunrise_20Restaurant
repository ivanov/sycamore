Vietnamese restaurant across from the G St Pub

'''$2.25 Sandwiches'''
These sandwiches are an excellent value - they come on fresh baked rolls and have your choice of Vietnamese style meat plus cilantro, peppers, cucumbers and mayonnaise. The folks who run this restaurant are super nice and accommodating, but many of them speak little English. They serve domestic as well as Vietnamese beer, both reasonably priced; pearl and other shakes. the rest of the menu looks pretty good but the sandwiches seem a little too good to pass up.

 * I suggest the vegetarian #8, made with fried rice noodles and tofu. mmm... delishskus. - ["GriffinWalker"]
 * I was really disappointed with this place. We won't be going back. Both of my friend's soups were horrible. One had just bones instead of duck. My chicken and eggroles dish wasn't good either. Someone ordered an avocado milkshake which was obviously made from powder. It's just typical massproduced crappy Vietnamese food. blech. - ["JackHaskel"]
 * I'd agree on the Sandwiches, not Entrees sentiment. I had a tofu dish with kinda putrid tofu, once. The sandwiches are great, though. At 3-4 bucks, they're really cheap. They remind me a lot of my last visit to Vietnam. For great pho, check out ["Hoa Viet"] - ["EricNguyen"]
 * I believe this is the one on G street.  The sandwiches aren't bad, much better than the ones at ["Fluffy Donuts"] - ["MarieHuynh"]
 *Yeah, this isn't a place to get entrees.  It's a place to get sandwiches.  And they're cheap, too. - ["JaimeRaba" jr]
