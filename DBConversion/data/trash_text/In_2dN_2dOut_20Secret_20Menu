You can order custom-made food at no additional cost (the only items that cost extra are the inventoried items such as cheese, meat, and buns).  While it's not on the printed menu, there are buttons on the cash register for these items. You can pretty much order anything you want, as long as they have the ingredients (e.g., putting onions in a milkshake).

= Burgers =
 * '''Stock:''' If you ordered your burgers off the menu they would come with:
  * a spread similar to thousand island dressing with mayonaisse.
  * one slice of tomato (two if one won't cover the entire bottom bun) and 
  * a portion of lettuce
  * Onions are always offered when you order. They come as a fresh slice by default, but chopped and grilled onions are available by request. The amount is constant regardless of the number of meat patties unless you ask for extra or lite of a condiment. 

''but instead consider ...''

= Custom Burgers =
 * '''Animal style''' is the most popular "secret" style. In addition to the standard toppings, animal style burgers include:
  * pickles
  * extra spread
  * extra grilled grilled onions
  * mustard fried onto each meat patty. 

 * '''Protein style''', popular among [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkins_diet Atkins dieters] and no/low carb eaters:
  * replaces the hamburger bun with large leaves of lettuce. 
  * It can be combined with other special orders, e.g., animal protein style. 

 * '''3×3, 4×4,''' or generally '''M × C,'''
  * Refers to a burger with a varied amount of meat patties (first number, M) and slices of cheese (second number, C). 
    * For example, the popular Double-Double would be 2×2, while a burger with 6 meat patties and 3 slices of cheese would be a 6×3. 

 * '''Double-Meat''' (a.k.a. 2×0) is a Double-Double with no cheese. 
  * By definition a Double-Double automatically includes two slices of cheese; for two patties without the cheese, a double meat burger must be ordered. 

 * '''The Flying Dutchman''':
  * Two meat patties
  * two slices of cheese 
  * no bun
  * Note: other condiments (including lettuce, tomato, spread, and onions) are not included unless you request them.

 * '''Grilled Cheese:'''
  * a sandwich with two slices of cheese 
  * no meat
  * the grilled cheese comes stock, with spread, tomatoes, lettuce, and onions if you would like.
    * Like most orders, this can be combined with other styles such as animal style. 

 * '''Wish Burger''' or''' Veggie Burger:''' 
   * sandwich containing only vegetables, and no meat or cheese. 

 * '''Mustard '''and/or''' ketchup''' can be substituted for the spread.  

= Custom Fries =
 * '''Fries well-done''' are extra crispy fries. 
 * '''Fries lite''' are fries that have been cooked less than normal. 
 * '''Fries animal style''' include two slices of melted cheese, grilled onions, and spread as toppings. 
 * '''"Cheese Fries"''' are fries with one or two slices of melted cheese. 
 * '''"Fries no-salt"''' have no salt added to them.
   * Another option is to order spread on the side, allowing you to use that instead of ketchup.
= Custom Milk Shakes =
 * A '''root beer float''' is a concoction made of half vanilla shake and half root beer soda. 
 * A '''neopolitan shake''' is a mixture of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry flavored shakes. 
 * Strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla can be '''combined in any way''', ie, just chocolate and vanilla, chocolate-strawberry, etc.
 * You can ask for '''extra syrup''' in your shake (ie extra chocolate or strawberry)
 * '''Large '''and''' extra large shakes''' are also available. The cup sizes for these shakes are one below soft drinks (i.e. a large shake is a medium soft drink cup, while an extra large shake is a large soft drink).
