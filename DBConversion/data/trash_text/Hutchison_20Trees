The trees along Hutchison Dr. on ["Campus"] are all tagged with ID numbers.

What in the world would happen if you switched the numbers around?  They seem to only be in semi-sequence as you walk in a given direction.  Is this how they keep track of the trees?  Do we keep careful records of every tree on campus -- enough to catalog their numbers?  If so -- that's pretty cool!
