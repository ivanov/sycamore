Mrak Hall is the primary location for the UC Davis administration.  The chancellor (currently ["Larry Vanderhoef"]) has his office in Mrak.  The offices of the registrar, Graduate Studies, ["College Of Ag" College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences] dean's office, and the Undergraduate Admissions and Outreach Services.

As an undergraduate, you will typically find yourself in Mrak to deal with registration issues.

The ["The Eggheads" Egghead] ["Eye On Mrak (Fatal Laff)"] sits right in front of Mrak Hall, keeping the administration in check.
