Hunan is the finest Chinese food restaurant in Davis. PLUS IT HAS A BAR! The food is always orgasmic and their prices are competitive. Their happy luncheon offers very generous portions of the entrée you order and also includes chow mein, your choice of steamed or fried rice, and soup or salad. The soup changes from day to day. Most of the lunch items range from between 4.50-5.00.  The lunch environment is somewhat informal. Almost any given day you will find a large group of college students around one of the larger round tables laughing and having a good time. The dinner environment is much more formal and quiet. Prices for dinner are more expensive but servings are much larger. Almost all Soups, Tofu, Vegetables, and Appetizers cost 4.00-6.00. Pork, Beef, and Chicken entrées typically run between 7.00-8.00 and Seafood dishes average between 8.50-11.50. If you don't want to eat there you can also place an order to go and get 10% off. 

I got this under control. Pictures soon. -DrunkIndie
