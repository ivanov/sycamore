Having trouble with a particular feature of the wiki or see something wrong?  File a bug report on this page!  Please include all the relevant information with every report, as in the following sample:
= Example =

 * '''User:''' ["MikeIvanov"]
 * '''Date and time:''' 5 PM November 24, 2004
 * '''Platform:''' Mac OSX
 * '''Browser:''' Firefox 1.0
 * '''Problem:''' The Java map takes forever to load and Firefox crashes.  This happens almost every time.

= General bugs =
 * '''User:''' ["PaulLanzi"]
 * '''Date and time:''' 1 AM December 6, 2004
 * '''Platform:''' Win2K
 * '''Browser:''' Firefox 1.0
 * '''Problem:''' After editing a page, the footer still has the "last edit" from the previous update, not the update that just completed.

  * '''Response''':  This is the known behavior.  The 'last edit' comes from the log which is updated in the background.  The only other alternative is to have the log updated before you 'see' the page, which would result in slow load times on edits.
  * ''I'd say it's still worth fixing at some point.  But yes, it's a very minor cosmetic bug.''
  * ''Why not set it so the browser reloads that page.  Wouldn't the tag that tells the browser not to cache it do this?''-["JaimeRaba" jr]
    * ''The issue is that the user sees the updated page, but the footer mentions the previous editor.  It doesn't have to do with caching, and after a reload, one would certainly see the new editor in the footer.  However, we did this for faster response time when saving a page.  There will be an elegant workaround for this.''-["MikeIvanov" Mike]

= Map-related bugs =

 * '''User:''' ["JackHaskel"]
 * '''Date and time:''' 1AM December 6, 2004
 * '''Platform:''' Mac OSX
 * '''Browser:''' Firefox 1.0
 * '''Problem:''' The Java map loads fast but Firefox crashes.  This happens most of the time, especially when I try to edit it or press the back button.
  * ''I have this same problem.  I suspect it's a problem with Firefox on OS X, which is really unstable.  I love Firefox but it crashes really often.  However, I can't use the map __at all__ in Firefox, and I'll point this out to Mike tonight.  For now the alternative is to use Safari, which never seems to crash on the map stuff at all.'' -- ["PhilipNeustrom"]
  * ''My impression is that it is a problem with applets on OS X in general.  While Safari uses JRE 1.4.x made by Apple, Firefox and other browsers cannot integrate this JRE on OS X and use 1.3.x instead.  I will try a few things, such as rebuilding the applet with the 1.3 JDK.  Meanwhile, you might want to have a look at the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaplugin/ Java Embedding Plugin], which allows Firefox, Camino, and others to use the latest JRE.  Let me know if this helps at all.'' - ["MikeIvanov"]
