Well liquor is the "default liquor" used to make a drink.  So if you ask for a vodka-cranberry (aka capecodder) without specifying what kind of vodka, you'll get their well ["Alcohol"].  A bar that uses decent well liquor uses only name brand ["Alcohol" Alcohols].  (Martin's is not a name brand.) 

The good well liquor list:
 * ["Pasta" Pasta?]
 * ["Soga's"]
 * ["Sophia's Thai Kitchen" Sophia's] (except on Wednesday, when they replace it with crap for their $1 wells)


Rules:  
 * Vodka:  Smirnoff or better.
 * Gin:  Gordons or better.
 * Tequilla:  Cuervo Gold or better
 * Rum:  Barcardi or better.
 * Whiskey:  Jim Beam or better.

Effects:
 * Less likely to get sick
 * Less likely to get hangover
 * Less likely to taste bad
