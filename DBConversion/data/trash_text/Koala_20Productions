A group of local Davis DJ's that do various events around the Northern California area.  The DJ's are anywhere from Chemistry Ph.D candidates to undergraduates to people that are not affiliated with the University at all.  If you are curious about some of the non-KDVS Davis music scene, you can check our their [http://www.dj-ak.org/djbios.html webpage].  Small intimate house parties with this group happen about twice a month.  However, be sure you bring vinyl if you want to come cause it's all about the music.
