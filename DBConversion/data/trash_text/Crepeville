Crepeville is famous for their crepes and the sheer number of students that bring their parents here when they come to visit.  The average crepe costs about $6, including browned potatoes.  A lot of people ["Study Spots" study here].  They also serve a full array of caffeinated beverages, making this an excellent place to plunk down for a few hours to use their ["WiFi Hot Spots" Wireless Internet] (802.11g only) and sample some tasty food.

''Crepeville is a great place for some good eatin'. The Chicken Pesto crepe is my favorite.'' - ["PaulIvanov"]

''I recommend the Cannelloni.'' - ["KenjiYamada"]

''Chicken Curry Crepe owns all.  Their pasta (served only after 4pm) is unexpectedly excellent.'' - ["PaulLanzi"]

''Perhaps one of the most sexist and racist employers in Davis. As they only hire attractive women as servers and Mexicans as cooks. But god damn them crepes are good.'' - ["RobRoy"]
