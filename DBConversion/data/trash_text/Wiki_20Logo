This is the very first logo used on the Davis Wiki.  It was used along with plain text.

It was supposed to remind you of the signs for bike circles and roundabouts that are littered about davis:

This logo was designed for the new theme:

In my opinion, this logo looks better with a tag line:

This one was a brainstorm idea that made ["PhilipNeustrom"] piss his pants:

Here is another logo idea, featuring a water tower(which was rejected because it looks like some kind of jelly fish):

''2004-08-01 07:34:54'' [[nbsp]] Also, Mike, the new sign actually smashes into the login boxes when you're not logged in - ["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2004-08-01 18:48:18'' [[nbsp]] Sorry about that.  You see, at my high resolution, it's hard to fathom there won't be room for something on someone's screen.  But I'll take it off for now until we figure out if it even belongs anywhere. - ["MikeIvanov"]
