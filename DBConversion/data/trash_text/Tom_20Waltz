Officer Thomas W. Waltz is known locally as the Midget Cop, due to his unusually low stature.  Waltz is only about one meter tall (that's 3'6" for you non-science majors). He's worked for the ["Davis Police Department"] for at least a couple years, and his badge number is 51.

He was mentioned in an [http://www.maximonline.com/stupid_fun/articles/article_3551.html article] in Maxim on the DPD's trading cards.

''When I met him, he seemed like a fairly nice guy, and pretty capable of his job.'' - ["BrentLaabs"]

Tom Waltz has reportedly transferred out of Davis. Any confirmation of this fact will be helpful.

''I saw Officer Waltz giving an inconsiderate speeder a ticket just two weeks ago.  I don't think he has been transferred.'' - ["JillWeinstein"]
