Everson Hall is home to the department of Textiles & Clothing. It is located in the south-eastern part of campus, just south of ["Shields Library"] and adjacent to ["Chemistry"]. Its main lecture hall is ["176 Everson"]. 

The Unitrans bus stops just in front of Everson, and ["Mrak Hall"] is a mere hop-skip-and-a-jump away, which makes Everson's location very handy for students who are on the up-and-up.
