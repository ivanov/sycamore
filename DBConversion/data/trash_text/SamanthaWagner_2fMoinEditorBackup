I am recent graduate of UC Davis with a BA in Anthropology (and ''yes'' anthro is cool!)  I don't know why my major is at all important.  Perhaps because I can often be found talking about anthro, much to the dismay of those around me.

I decided to stay in Davis, because it brings me much joy.  I currently work full-time (eek!  I'm a real adult!) as an office administrator for an environmental consulting firm called Stillwater Sciences.  Wanna know a secret?  I honestly love my job.  I definitely lucked out there.

Aren't they precious?
