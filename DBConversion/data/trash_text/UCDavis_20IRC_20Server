There used to be an IRC server set up on ucd-irc.ucdavis.edu . It really only had one public channel, #ucd, and its primary users some people who worked in the ["Campus Data Center"]. They've moved their chatty talk elsewhere, because it shut down in the beginning of 2004.

Good evening,

This afternoon, a private server (think.ucdavis.edu) that was providing 
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) service as ucd-irc.ucdavis.edu was taken out 
of service by its owner and is no longer available. If any IRC user 
believes that there are compelling business reasons for IET to provide 
this service to the campus, please contact me at (mwmellor@ucdavis.edu).
