''Someone needs to make a good Unitrans page (don't just copy-paste, that's sorta useless)''
 * The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitrans Wikipedia page] is terrific, but I'm sure we can do much better than that.
 * [http://www.ci.davis.ca.us/gis/unitrans/index.cfm Unitrans Bus Route Map]
 * The [http://unitrans.ucdavis.edu/index.cfm official Unitrans site] has some [http://unitrans.ucdavis.edu/about/ history and info]
 * Another great source of into is the big poster in the Unitrans stop in the ["Memorial Union"] area of ["Campus"] -- it tells about how ASUCD formed Unitrans and explains the driving of the double-decker buses and the (!!) prison buses that Unitrans originally used.
