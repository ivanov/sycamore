''I don't know how it is with the kids these days, but I remember back in my time the big word around the High Schools of America was that UCD students were big-time cow tippers. Well I don't know about that, but hardly any of these cows look tipped over to me.'' -- ["TravisGrathwell"]

If you're good, you can pet baby cows!  The entire area with the cows is open to the public, but you should follow some guidelines for the cows' health.  Look around, pick your favorite, and pet that one.  Petting them all at once can transfer diseases between them all and you don't want to get a baby cow sick, do you??  Plus, picking your favorite cow gets all the other cows to Moo.

The cows live in ["The Dairy"].

Cows (along with freshman) are the main source of the ["Essence of Davis"].
