= Bike Stores =
 * ["Bike Barn"]
  * Lots of knowledgeable people here. Very friendly. Good place to go for bike maintenance help.  Unless of course you want something ''done'', like having a headset pressed.
 * ["Ken's Bike & Ski"]
  * Very friendly staff. Some road bikes, more mountain bikes. - ["EricKlein"]
   * ''We have way more bikes in stock than you see on the floor. We have some pretty good deals on road bikes, and it's easy for us to nail the fit if we have to order you something. Feel free to read my comments on the ["Ken's Bike & Ski" Ken's wiki page].'' - ["KenNeville"]
 * ["B&L Bike Shop"]
  * Again, friendly knowledgeable staff. Great place for most bike needs. I enjoy giving them my business when practical. Small selection of road bikes, but good overall bike selection. - ["EricKlein"]
   * ''I've been riding in Davis a lot longer than I've been working at Ken's, and B&L gets my business when I can't find what I need at my shop. I got my first real mountain bike from them many years ago and have gotten great service from these guys.'' - ["KenNeville"]
 * ["Wheelworks"] 
   * This is the serious road bike place in Davis. Whether you want a good mid-range road bike, a serious racing bike, or a hardcore triathlon bike, this is the place. My experience here is mixed. Sometimes the people are quite friendly, and sometimes they're a bit aloof. If you are new to road biking and want a relaxed environment, this might not be a good first store. If you are more experienced, and know what you want, this place is just the ticket. - ["EricKlein"]
 * ["Freewheeler"]

= Popular local road rides =
 * ["Winters"]: Start at Russell and 113. Follow the bikepath to its end (about 5 miles out). Turn left on Stevenson Bridge Road. Stay on this road until after the ["Stevenson Bridge" bridge] when you can make a right turn onto ["Putah Creek"] Road (this should be about 6-6.5 miles after you first start).  Follow Putah Creek Road all the way to Winters. You will know you are in Winters when the road stops at a three way intersection, and there is an old bridge to the right. Just go right over the old bridge, and treat yourself to one of ["Winters"]' excellent restaurants. Total distance: 13.5 miles (27 if biking back as well). 
 * Pedricks/Dixon: Start just south of campus on Old Davis Road (i.e. start at the campus south gate, if you know where that is. It's right next to the Mondavi Center). Ride south on Old Davis Road. This is kind of a fun road, and the scenery makes for a nice relaxed weekend ride. Eventually Old Davis Road will dead-end at Tremont Road. Turn right here. Follow Tremont Road until it ends at the frontage road along the 80, then turn left. Follow the frontage road until it hits the overpass, and cross over on the overpass. On the other side of the overpass is a gas station and Pedricks produce stand, which is nice place to stop for a snack. Total milage: about 6 (not sure exactly). Alternate ways home: 
  * Go north on Pedrick road until you get to Russell (not very far really, maybe 4-5 miles). Turn right on Russell to head home.
  * Head west on Severs Road. About 2 miles out, you'll come to Stevenson Bridge Road, make a right here. Follow Stevenson Bridge Road north until it hits Russell (after you've crossed over the ["Stevenson Bridge" bridge]). Turn right on Russell (onto the bikepath), and head home. This will make the full loop about 20 miles.[[BR]]

[[BR]]Trail Eastbound between Davis and Sacramento

 * ["Sacramento"]: Take 3rd street east, until it hits L street. Make a right on L street, and it'll curve around into Second street. Stay on second. It will cross over Mace road, and eventually become County Road 32A. Stay on this. It will eventually cross over the railroad tracks, and keep heading east. Eventually this road comes to the causeway, and loops around under the freeway. Instead of heading under the freeway, get off the road here, and get onto the bike path (which starts just north of the road). This bike path goes along the north side of the causeway (and is somewhat isolated from the freeway traffic). Just stay on this path until the causeway ends. It can be a bit noisy in heavy traffic (and a bit windy). Just past the end of the causeway, the bike path eventually ends, but right across the street is ["Eppies"] diner. It is a decent place to grab breakfast or lunch before heading back to Davis, and the staff has always been friendly when I've been there. On the way back to Davis, you will see the ["Frog Signs"]. Total distance: 10 miles one way (from A street).
 * ["Lake Berryessa"]: Follow the directions above to Winters (about 13.5 miles). Instead of turning right and crossing the old bridge into ["Winters"], turn left to stay on Putah Creek Road. Stay right at any intersections you come to. Eventually you will get out to Pleasant Valley Road (past Lake Solano Park). Turn right here, and you will soon arrive at the 128 (and a little gas station for snacks and whatnot). From here, you will stay on the 128 the whole way. NOTE: The traffic here can kinda suck. Be warned, you've got to lookout for yourself on this road. There is no bike lane, and no shoulder most of the way from here on out. I recommend a helmet mirror so you aren't surprised when the giant SUV towing the monster warship behind it comes barreling past. That being said, a lot of the drivers can be quite courteous, and will often give you lots of room as they pass, mainly the big guys towing boats are the worst here (oddly enough, the motorcyclists can also be pretty bad, because the crotch-rocket guys like to see how close the can come without actually clipping you). Eventually you will get to a short (but steep if you aren't used to it) climb up to the top of the dam. If it is spring or early summer, I highly recommend stopping at the top of the dam for a look at the giant drain hole. It's an odd sight when it's working. NOTE on the downhill on the way back: This hill is a lot of fun, and you get to build up some impressive speed if you are careful. Total milage, about 22-23 miles from Davis. Alternate distances:
  * Keep going after the dam. In about 2-3 miles, you'll come to a little store where you can get some snacks, popsickles, or whatever. If you bike from Davis, and turn around here, you've got a nice 50 mile ride.
  * If you keep going after that little store, you immediately hit what local cyclists refer to as "cardiac hill". This is a good name for this hill. It is about 1 mile long, and is relatively steep. If I remember correctly, it gains about 600-800 feet over that mile. You'll feel good once you get to the top though. Also, if you are foolhardy, you can build up some really impressive speed on the way back down. Just be safe about it. Don't go faster than you are comfortable with, because a fall at 50 mph would really suck. After the top, you can enjoy a long downhill descent (which you'll have to climb again later). Eventually, about 12 miles after the little store, you'll come to another little store where you can get some more snacks. If you go straight, you'll eventually get to Napa. If you go right, you'll get to other parts of ["Lake Berryessa"], and if you turn back here, you'll have done a nice 75 mile ride (with some moderate hills in the mix).

''Blatantly stolen from the ["Ken's Bike & Ski" Ken's] [http://kensbikeski.com/site/page.cfm?PageID=120 website], I'll fix some of the poorer directions soon... - ["KenNeville" kn]''

=== Las Posadas State Forest ===
Las Posadas is located 3 miles S.E. of Calistoga in Angwin. This trail system has everything a mountain biker could want. Shady single track through manzanita tunnels, smooth fast descents down the back side fire roads, lazy table tops, rock drops and beautiful views from Inspiration Point. Moderate climbs around the park offer more technical terrain, rock drops, log sections, whoop de doos and other obstacles as well. Lots of cool shade to keep it fun.  Come explore this hidden jewel among the vineyards of the Napa Valley with us. See map.

=== Rockville Park ===
Rockville is Fairfield's little mountain bike haven.  Located just out of town to the northwest, Rockville County park offers a variety of great terrain.  A short climb brings you to a valley surrounded by small peaks.  From here, everything you see is fair game.  Rolling fire roads, twisting single track, easy-to-treacherous descents, rock drops/gardens/jumps, and beautiful oak woodlands surround a lake with strategically placed picnic benches.  So saddle up and let's go ride, we're sure you'll love it.

=== Salmon Falls ===
Salmon Falls (take U.S. 50 East to El Dorado Hills Blvd. North; keep right onto Salmon Falls Road and park your vehicle near the bridge at Salmon Falls) has two trails to choose from: The Sweetwater trail is located on the south side of Folsom lake; the first part of this trail is the most technical, followed by smooth fast single track. Lots of shade on this trail keeps you cool. Great trail for all levels of mountain bikers, you're sure to enjoy this fun roller coaster ride through the trees. Salmon Falls trail is located on the North side, across the bridge. This trail starts with a fun winding section with a couple of small rock sections.  After the first half mile, the trail opens up and starts winding through the trees along the lake shore.  One or two short climbs await you, along with a lot of rolling single track and great views.  Both of these rides are out-and-back, so once you feel you have gone far enough, turn around and enjoy the views from the other direction. 

=== Forest Hill ===
Foresthill Divide trail is a great loop ride.  Located off Foresthill Road in Auburn, parking is about 3 miles up on the left, where you'll see a meadow and trailhead.  Approximately 11 miles long, the trail winds its way parrallel to Foresthill road and consists of shady single track and fire roads on the south side of the road.  There are a few moderate climbs and at least one that will challenge some riders. When the trail ends, follow the road up 200 yards and cross to a recently finished (2yrs or so) medium-width single track that rolls back down to the start.  There is a picnic table so you can rest before the downhill half of the ride.  Then sit back and enjoy the trail through the forest, it's mellow and fun going back. 

=== Clementine Loop ===
Clementine loop is located just east of Auburn on Hwy 49. This trail starts with a long moderate climb to the top. The descent is fast single track lined with small to medium jumps and rocky sections along the trail. This trail is not for the novice, but after a few rides you'll be ready.  The best part of this ride is that it ends at the American River near a swimming hole, so you work hard then relax.

=== Pioneer Trail ===
Pioneer Trail is located just out of Nevada City along Hwy 20.  You can park at Five Mile House and get a trail map of the area as well as a great sandwich and goodies.  The trail starts right behind the house and parallels the road.  This is a great escape from the Valley's heat, it is just high enough to remain cool and there is tons of shade.  The trail is great for beginners along the first 5-6 miles, then crosses the road to White Cloud Campground where the intermediate and advanced stuff starts.  Watch for horses on the weekend as this is a multi use trail.
