The Davis Borders is large and inviting, although some wouldn't recommend buying books there.

Of particular note is their giant (and continually-expanding) manga section.  Their role playing section is woefully out of date, unsorted and appears to be a fairly random selection.  Some books appear in Science Fiction/Fantasy despite being pure rulebooks.

Borders shuffles its inventory frequently, throwing out books (sans front covers) at the rate of about 1/2 cubic meter / week, and magazines at about double that rate.  This, combined with their lack of attention to detail in shredding, makes the ["Dumpster Diving" dumpsters] behind the store particularly fruitful.  The employees are tolerant, although they would prefer that you not pick through the garbage during business hours.  (Also, please return the books to the dumpster when you are done browsing through them.  Thank you.)
