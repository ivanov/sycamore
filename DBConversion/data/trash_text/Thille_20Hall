Thille Hall is the collective name for ["Tercero"] buildings A through F. This group makes up the northwestern portion of the Tercero area, bordered by Dairy Road and Tercero Hill Circle.

A note of interest: While physical Thille is buildings A-F, the Thille RA Staff consists of only A-E. F Building RAs are included in the Pierce Staff.
