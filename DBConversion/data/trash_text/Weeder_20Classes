Weeder classes "weed" people out of majors that they do not belong in or are likely to do poorly in.  ECS 30, 40 and 110, when taught by ["Sean Davis"], are examples of weeder classes.  Some people avoid "weeder profs" like the plague and manage to squeak by, but don't do so well later on.   

ECS 222A is a fine example of a graduate weeder class. If you survive this class, you should have no problem with any other grad ECS class.

Weeder classes can also be found in the ["Biological Sciences"]. Basic weeder classes help people realize that they ''really'' don't want to go to Med School or do labwork.

Chem 2A,B,C are seen as weeder courses, but all of the upper division chemistry classes are much harder.
All organic chemisty classes can be seen as weeders- Chem 8A,B,C; 118A,B,C; and 128A,B,C.

After going through these courses, the people taking the classes beyond them are usually seen as being pretty serious about what they are doing.
