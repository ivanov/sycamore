= Something to keep in mind =
Don't panic!  These are just suggestions and you are under no obligation to follow them -- but keep in mind that others may decide to change your pages' names, links, and content to match these guidelines.  We are trying to create a flexible, creative environment, but also one without a whole lot of confusion.  This guide should be taken with a grain of salt.

We never want guidelines to interfere with your ability or motivation for expressing yourself and getting your ideas out.  Your ideas are the most important thing.  This is a ''style guide'', which means it's just the style we try to aim for to make sure we're all on the same page when it comes to conventions.

= What should I name my page? =
If you're making a page, picking a good name for it is important.  If the place/idea has a ''proper'' name then you should try and make that the page name.  For instance, Kerr Hall is often referred to as simply "Kerr" but you should make the page name "Kerr Hall" because this is the officially used name of the building.  When you decide to link to Kerr, you can/should link to it with whatever name you want, be it ["Kerr Hall" Kerr], ["Kerr Hall"], or ["Kerr Hall" the Mathematics building].  When making a page for something without a universal name, just use the normal rules for capitalization in the English language.

Sometimes it's not clear what the real name of the place/thing/idea you're making a page for ''should'' be.  In these cases of confusion, just make a decision as to what the page name should be, then make note of the alternative possibilities in the page itself. Referring to the other possible names allows people to do searches and find the page under any of the possible names.  An example of this is the ["24 Hour Reading Room"], which is known as both the "Extended Hours Reading Room" and the "24 Hour Reading Room".  It's not clear what the name of the page should be, so a simple reference to the other name  (somewhere in the page, probably toward the beginning) fixes this and allows people to find it in a '''search''' (searching is very important for people who don't use the site regularly).  Also, making redirects (by making the page contain only the line {{{#redirect The name of the page}}}) allows the other names to be used without problems -- they will simply redirect to the one page, whatever it happens to be named.

What do you guys think of capitalizing the first word of a page name and leaving the rest lower-case unless it's a proper name?  Personally, I think it looks much better. - ["MikeIvanov"]

== A note on names for people ==
If you want to make a page about someone, say the UCD Chancellor, Larry Vanderhoef, you should probably name that page "Larry Vanderhoef" (note the space).  When there are pages for people where their name ''isn't'' spaced out, such as {{{FirstnameLastname}}}, this is the page ''for'' that user --  for their ''username''.  If you know they're going to sign up for the wiki, or if they aren't famous or really important at all, then it doesn't much matter.  The with pages that have a ''username'' as their title are going to be the page associated with that user (it's up in their upper right hand corner all the time, it's automatically a link when they make an edit, etc).

Think of it this way:  the username page is the page ''for'' that person to use.  The page with the name spaced out is the page where historical information about them might go.

=== Simple rule ===
Pages with peoples' NamesLikeThis are pages for people ''on'' the wiki to ''use''.  Pages with Names Like This for people are pages for people from a more biographical standpoint.


= Search! =
Searching is very important!  Before you make a page you should do a search for it and similar items to make sure the page doesn't already exist.  If the page already exists, add to it!  If it exists but has (as you feel) the incorrect name, then feel free to Rename it (by going into Edit and pressing "Rename" down under the edit area) -- be sure to state your reason.  After renaming the page you should change the old links to the old name to the new name -- again, by doing a search :) (search for the old page name) -- note:  you don't ''have'' to do this, as the old page name will automatically redirect to the new page name, but it's good style, and good style is sexy.

= Be kind and courteous! =
:)

= Layout Stuff =
== Order of Lists ==
Generally, when listing a bunch of links or just making a list in an article, they should be organized alphabetically, unless there is a good reason to do otherwise.

== Conversations and Comments ==
Often times the conversations or comments inside of a page contribute a lot to the page's worth.  If possible, integrate and re-structure the page to reflect the important information contained in comments.  If a comment is directed at you and it's hardly valuable to anyone else after you've read it, then removing it un-clutters the page.  Leaving the subjective/experience-based poritions of comments attributed to those who make them keeps (more) subjective knowledge around.

= Simple conventions =
 * Avoid use of the words "I" or "me" unless you are attributing text to yourself.
 * Want a fact checked? Write ''(please check)'' next to something you want checked.  Want a photo taken?  Write ''(photo request)'' next to something you want a photo of.  Doing this will allow for determined folks to easily search for the phrases ''please check'' and ''photo request'' to find things to do.
