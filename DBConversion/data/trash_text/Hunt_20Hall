Hunt Hall is extremely notable for being the first real building you see on your right if you enter campus from the north. It's also pretty much the last building you see on your left if you find yourself marching north from the ["Memorial Union" MU]. It is probably home to a lot of valuble faculty who do important research, prominently in the field of Big Science.

Hunt Hall is also due for some sort of rennovation, or so says the large sign that faces the MU bus terminal.
