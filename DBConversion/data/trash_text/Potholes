Davis came to worldwide attention when former mayor Julie Partansky (then councilmember) argued that the potholes in six alleys in town should not be paved because of their historic significance.  (She argued that they were part of the original building materials, and as such were part of the fabric of the neighborhood as it was originally conceived).

Rush Limbaugh carried the story.  Late night talk show hosts carried the story, and CNN broadcast it around the world.  The Associated Press picked up the story, reporting  "...this is Davis, a town so politically correct that smoking is restricted even outdoors and there are ["Toad Tunnel" little tunnels] under a freeway for frog crossings."

Potholes are so associated with Davis now that it's no wonder that the huge dips along ["Covell" Covell Blvd.] go unpaved, causing a thrill ride every time one comes off the ["Highway 113" freeway] and heads for ["Anderson Rd."].

["River City Bank"] has signs that read "This Hole Sponsored by River City Bank".  You can see one in their window on E Street.
