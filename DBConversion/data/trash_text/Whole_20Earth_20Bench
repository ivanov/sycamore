This bench was constructed during an building materials workshop at the ["Whole Earth Festival"] in 2004.  It lives on the pathway to ["Wellman Hall"] from ["The Quad"].  It is made of cob. Cob is a construction material made of clay, sand, and straw. During the summer of 2004 it was sprayed with linseed oil, which is an agent for protecting wood (and, apparently, masses of concentrated dirt).

It also seems to have the remains of a pot inside of it.

This is actually the second such bench that has been built on campus. The first one was built under a tree on the quad during WEF'03, but the administration insisted that it be destroyed.

*Inquiries on the subject of why anyone would want to sit on a huge dirt clod that bears more than a passing resemblance to a piece of poo will likely have to wait until the hippies come back next year.
 *don't wait for the hippie flood in May. Seek the counsel of a local Davis ["Hoopies" Hoopie].
