["Reg Card"] is an abbreviation for Registration Card, or Student ID.

["Reg Card"]s are notorious for having distorted, ill-cropped, and overall just bad photos of students.  Student ID photos are submitted with your Statement of Intent to Register (SIR).  

The front of the ID contains the ["Seal Of The University"], the words "University of California; Davis", the student's first and last name, student ID number, ID type ("Undergraduate", "Graduate", "Official", etc), number of times a replacement card has been issued, a barcode and accompanying barcode number, and (optionally) a blue dot to indicate whether the holder has paid ASUCD fees (for ["Unitrans"], etc).

The back of the ID contains differing items, depending upon what year the student is.  Three years ago the ["Aggie Logo"] was on the back.  Then the following year that logo was replaced by the ["Davis Principles Of Community"].  A scannable magnetic (black) strip is on the back of all issued IDs.

A ["Reg Card"] allows such things as:
 *A ride on ["Unitrans"]  or ["Yolobus"] - Note: Only if the card has the magical undergrad blue dot
 *books from any of the libraries on campus (["Shields Library" Shields], ["Physical Sciences Library" Physical Sciences and Engineering], ["Health Sciences Library" Carlson Health Sciences])
 *entrance to the ["ARC"]
 *purchasing credit that is billed on a student's account on ["UC Davis Bookstore" campus bookstores]
 *a "swipe" at the ["Dining Commons"]
 *student ["Discounts and Freebies" discounts] such as free drinks and cheaper ["Movie Theaters" movie] tickets.

Some ["Frat Parties"] admit on the basis of a UC Davis ["Reg Card"].

A new ["Reg Card"] can be purchased for $12 (or $15?) in ["Mrak Hall"].  They take your picture again and deactivate your old ID. If your card gets damaged, the Registrar's office can give you a replacement for free.

*One more thing to mention about Reg Cards: If you lose yours, your life is essentially over until you get it replaced. As a ["Freshmen" Freshman], losing your Reg Card means you can't eat, you can't get into your dorm and basically you don't exist for the time being. But really, its not that big of a deal. Freshman just get really freaked out when they lose theirs, so its kinda funny to watch.
