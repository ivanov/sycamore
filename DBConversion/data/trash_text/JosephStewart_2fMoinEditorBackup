Joseph is sophomore who is probably majoring in Enviromental Biology and Management.  He is an advocate of ["Choice Voting"] and other more democratic voting systems.  He is running for ["Senate" senate] with ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"] and has the coolest marble-pink ["Bicycles" bike] known to man.

=Joseph's (still evolving) Senate Platform:=
My Platform is divided into two categories-- things that are feasable, and things that i will have virtually no power to change as a Senator)

===Feasible Things:===

 *'''Choice Voting Education'''- to date ["ASUCD"] has yet to produce any materials explaining ["Choice Voting"] to the student population, instead relying on ["The California Aggie"] to do it for them.

 *'''Return ["Campus Staplers" staplers] to the Copy Rooms on Campus''' -yup

 *'''Fiscal Responsibility''' -not wasting money on fire trucks, eliminating redundant commisions filled with ["Kalen Gallagher" Kalen Gallagher's] cronies, spending less of your money on the ["Senate" senate] retreat.

 *'''Improve Tipsy Taxi'''- Currently ["Tipsy Taxi"] has only one phone line.  If we were to have as many phone lines as we have dispatchers we could fully utilize the tipsy vans...If necesary increase the number of vans as well.
        
 *'''["Countback"] Ammendment'''- Since his inception ["Kalen Gallagher"] has appointed FOUR senators to replace those who resigned: ["Adam Barr" Barr], ["Senator Ackerman Scandal" Ackerman], ["Nafeh Malik" Malik] and ["Sean Ruel" Ruel] (thats one third of the senate!). ["Choice Voting"] lets the people appoint thier senators, not have the executive do it for them.  This is done by tallying the votes from the last election in a "countback." This way see who would have been elected if a retired senator had been removed from the election and thier votes had transfered to the voter's next choice.

Uh...lots of other things too. I'll remember them some time.


===Things I want to change but won't really have power over:===

 *'''End Political ["Davis Apartheid" Apartheid] in Davis'''- Currently ["Davis"] ["City Council"] elections are held during the summer when students are not in town to vote.  Moving the elections to the first Tuesday in November (like most cities) would yield a more student friendly city council.
    * I'm going to the ["Davis Governance Task Force"] about this Monday Jan 31, 7pm. Join me. BTW, elections are moving only in even years (which does include the city council elections), but they're going to be a week or two before finals. They're moving to the Tuesday after the first Monday of June -- which means between June 2 and June 8, inclusive. -- ["KenBloom"]

 *'''Go Back to Division 2'''- Students are indebted enough without this extra fee.  If you disagree, don't worry as the ["UCD Administrative Officers"] do not really care what students or faculty think about this issue anyhow. (Insert link of explanation here)
