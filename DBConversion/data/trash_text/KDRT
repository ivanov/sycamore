'''''Hi, thanks for creating this wiki page about KDRT.  When I have the time I'll edit this page, but this will have to suffice for now.  I'd suggest reading our webpage's Press section, though it is lacking in aesthetics at the moment, if you are interested in what has been printed about us so far.  The pirate and microradio movement has a long history, reaching much farther back than when I wrote & submitted KDRT's application to the FCC in 2000.  Locally, one only has to look as far as Mark Chang, who built a transmitter which broadcasted Davis Live Radio back in the 1990's.  Maybe he'll eventually edit a wiki page about microradio in Davis.  And hey man, I get KDRT all the way to Dixon. : )  -Jeff'''''


= Station Information = 
Broadcasting on 101.5 FM, KDRT (say k-dirt) is the local community Davis radio station. The station is run out of a closet (I'm not kidding) in the ["DCTV"] building. ["Jesse Drew"] of the ["Technocultural Studies"] department is heavily involved in the station. The station has 100 Watts of transmitter powered. It is widly belived that their transmitter was actually constructed from a lightbulb.  The [http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/FMTV-service-area?x=FL628744.html FCC site] shows that the transmitter range is quite limited, but does encompass all of Davis.

= Station History =
KDVS veteran and now Pacifica Network Reporter, Sakura Saunders, took it upon herself to help start up KDRT, the "half-brother-step-cousin" of ["KDVS"].  Saunders mobilized KDVS volunteers after receiving the low wattage license to make carts (pre-recorded announcements) and mix cds for the first few days of air (the station went live on September 24, 2004 at 6pm).  For the first two weeks, DJs would just change cds and keep rotating them.  

Luckily, another ["KDVS"] manager (["NixGlass" Nix Glass]) stepped in and helped train some of the on-air KDRT djs.  Some have thought that KDRT would be a threat to ["KDVS" KDVS 90.3FM].  They are complementary stations and you lose KDRT when you pass Covell or get on any freeway anyway.  Its VERY low wattage.  Switch on over to 101.5 when you don't like what's on ["KDVS"].

= More about Low Power FM =
Normal commercial and non-commercial FM stations broadcast their signal with thousands, sometimes tens of thousands, of watts of power.  Low Power FM stations are limited to 100 watts, which makes for a average broadcast zone of just 3.5 miles.  Largely seen as a response to the mass purchase of commercial radio stations by companies such as [http://www.clearchannel.com/ ClearChannel], Low Power FM stations hold the promise of continuing truly independent radion into the next decade.
