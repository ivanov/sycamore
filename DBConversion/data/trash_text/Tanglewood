Tanglewood (1880 & 2020 Cowell Blvd, in ["South Davis"]) is commonly referred to as 'nice'. Though several residents can attest that the apartments are made quite cheaply (e.g. windows that don't close, poor heating system, etc.) but on the plus side, every apartment has a washer and dryer. It is the first apartment community you encounter as Richards Blvd. turns into Cowell Blvd., though it extends a little bit past Drew Circle, where the smaller, 2020 portion of Tanglewood can be found.

Life in Tanglewood is quiet most of the time, composed of young families, older folks, and some students. There aren't many parties in these apartments anymore, but they have two very nice pools are and spas.  Tanglewood has a computer lab, two workout rooms with tv, basketball and tennis courts, a sauna, and a lounge area with a kitchen (usually with a plate of cookies) and piano. Management is somewhat flaky and ditzy, and also has an absurdly high turnover rate, but whose management isn't like that around here?
