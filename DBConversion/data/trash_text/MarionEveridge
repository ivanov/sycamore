Marion Everidge is a charmingly lovely little girl of a mere eighteen years who enjoys riding her banged-up mountain bike in the rainy streets of ["Davis"] during the cold early hours of the morning. Then again, she enjoys most about anything.

Her desk is currently in an occupied state of disarray; where her neon pink post-its polkadot her shelves and disheveled papers migrate across the surface in a frenzy of parallel lines. Nevertheless, she successfully finds a balance within her chaotic world. And as chaos goes, she thrives on unexpected occurances; for example finding $5 bills on the ground or winning free food. 

[[center(begin)]]Marion likes a great many things, the list includes, but is not limited to:
the seaside, kayaking, snorkeling, blue painters tape, novelty objects, dirt, chicken strips with fries, backpacking, outdoor gear, poetry, obscure jokes, history, traveling to distant lands, exploring ["Thrift Stores"] and garage sells, vintage clothing, black & white photography, her 1985 mercedez station wagon, comics, sleeping, food, still water with the evening sun glistening upon it, her stupid brown dog, ["Trivia"] questions, birds returning to their nests, and popcorn on rainy days.[[center(end)]]

But basically folks, Marion Everidge is an explorer; currently on her life's first major adventure. She is watching her steps- one step at a time. Her current goals include becoming cuddlely, riding her bike with no hands(I'm sorry, its hard) and learning how to ski. Let's hear it for Marion. Plus she has short hair and that is really cool, not to mention bold.
