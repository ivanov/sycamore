Apartments are things that most non-Freshman students live in.  (Except ["engineering students"], who live in ["Kemper Hall"])  Some apartments are just a block away from campus, others are much farther away.  The apartment complexes that are closest to campus are usually the older ones.  Rent can be as low as $250 or so if you share a room.  

Some complexes have pretty nice managers and maintenance guys, but some of the owners can be a bit shady (ie the people that own ["Sycamore Lane Apartments"]).  On ["Moving Day"] all of these apartments' dumpsters are ransacked and the town turns to chaos.

If you give your opinion of the complex you live in then others might find that useful when looking for an apartment. Also provide your opinion about various ["Property Management"] Companies.
