The Quick Shop Market is your general 7-11 esq. store. They Sell wine, beer, hard alcohol, snack-food, bathroom neccessities, ["Smokers" cigarettes] and other general merchandise. I've also noticed ["Bros"] buying kegs on the weekends. It's right across  Poleline from the ["Davis Cemetery"].

 * Quick Shop Market has the cheapest kegs in town. Although ["Aggie Liquor"] has a better selection. - ["RobRoy"]
 * They also sell two blunts for a dollar, by far the best deal in town. - ["DanMasiel"]
 * Interesting trivia: the ["ATMs" ATM] here has a dial-up modem, it's probably one of the last places you'll be able to hear that boinging sound. -["AmeliaCarlson" aec]
