Amtrak is one of the easiest ways to ["Transportation" get out] of ["Davis"] to ["Sacramento"] or the ["Bay Area"] via the Capitol Corridor.  The Capitol Corridor is a commuter train with unreserved seating. Ticket prices jump during holidays, but fares are discounted during the summer.  Before boarding, passengers should buy tickets at the train station to avoid grumpy conductors and the extra 50% charge for buying tickets on board.

Normal Prices from Davis:
 * A one-way train ticket to Sacramento costs $5.50
 * A one-way train ticket to San Jose costs $21
 * A one-way train ticket to Martinez costs $10
 * A one-way ticket to the Richmond Station is $14
  * This is very useful for getting to San Francisco and the rest of the Bay Area because Amtrak shares the station with ["BART"]. So you can get to the middle of the City for a total of just over $17.50.
 * For $17.00, a one-way ticket will take you (by train) to Emeryville, and then to San Francisco via Amtrak coach (bus).
  * The coach makes stops at the Ferry Building, Fisherman's Warf, the Financial Center, Union Square, the Moscone Center and finally, the bus stop at the CalTrain station on 4th and Townsend Streets.  The Embarcadero BART station is across the street from the Ferry Building.
  *This is actually the cheapest way to take mass transit into San Francisco from Davis and doesn't require you to change transportation systems, like the above suggestion does.
   * Actually, it's quite simple changing between Amtrak and BART. All you need to do is walk down a flight of stairs from the Amtrak platform, walk through the station to the BART ticket thingy, and then go up an escalator to the BART platform.
    * It may be simple, but it's more expensive to take Amtrak and BART versus just taking Amtrak.
     * Amtrak plus BART only costs about 50 cents more to SF and $1 more to Fremont.  Also, taking both will usually save you time if you're going to SF.  The only reason to take Amtrak directly is if the station's location happens to be convenient
 * Amtrak '''will''' raise their rates around a certain travel-heavy period of the year, and you can expect to pay an extra 4 dollars or so.
 * Buying a ticket on board the train rather than at the station will cost an extra fee of 50% of the ticket's price.  If you board at a station that does not have an attendant, however, you do not have to pay the fee.
  * if you're particularly poor you can risk this and attempt to stowaway.
 * In most autombiles, you're going to use 3 gallons of gas (@30mpg) each way (=$6), plus Tolls ($3 each way).  So, it is still cheaper to drive yourself.  But it is usually faster to take the Train because of no traffic.  And I'd usually pay the extra $6 to avoid Traffic.  And actually if you're stuck in traffic, your Gas Mileage will be actually much worse.  And if you drive a 5.7L V-8 Truck, it's more cost effective to take the train anyway. I just wish BART and Amtrak ran later.  -["JaimeRaba" jr]

A few national train routes pass through Davis. The Coastal Starlight travels along the beautiful Pacific coastline from Seattle to Los Angeles. Meanwhile, the California Zephyr originates in San Francisco and ends in Chicago. It may not be the cheapest way to travel, but there are beautiful parts of the world only seen from train tracks.


''If you're traveling on Amtrak, always plan to arrive at your destination 1/2 hour late. I don't know why it happens, but it does'' --["KenBloom"] [[BR]] ''But do not arrive late to the ["Amtrak Station"] because the train may show up a couple minutes early, it happened to me at the ["Bay Area" Santa Clara] station when I was coming back to ["Davis"]. I watched my train leave without me stranding me in Sunnyvale.'' - ["RobRoy"]
