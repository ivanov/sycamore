Liberty's Flame is a conservative (not necessarily Republican party line) paper put on by the Young Conservatives Foundation (YCF), a nonprofit registered corporation that exists solely for the purpose of putting out the paper.  ASPAPERS cannot produce the quality they prefer, and, well, they have the resources to produce it without ["AS Papers"], so it is printed a believe by a company in ["Sacramento"].  YCF gets its funding from grants from other conservative organizations and advertising space (Unlike the liberal papers on campus, YOU aren't paying for its production.  Be happy).

It is true however that most (all?) members of the YCF board are or have recently been members of the ["Davis College Republicans"]



= Untrue Speculation =
A publication unleashed by the ["Davis College Republicans"].
