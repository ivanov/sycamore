Davis' local obligatory Carl's Jr. which also happens to be paired with a Green Burrito, which is common practice in Sothern California. Somehow, the Davis Carl's Jr. manages to be sufficently worse that other Carl's Jr's and should be avoided at all costs.

There is also a Carli's Jr. inside of ["The Silo"].
