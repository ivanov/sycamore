Visitors and new arivals in Davis may find ["Covell"] vs. ["Cowell"] confusing.  To make things more confusing, both streets have thier own ["Safeway"], ["Dos Coyotes"] and ["Great Clips for Hair"].

["Covell"] (co-VELL) is a long, straight street that runs east to west across ["North Davis"].  (Old timers in Davis pronounce it "CO-vul.")

["Cowell"] (COW-el) is a somewhat long snaking street that serves ["South Davis"]. As you take ["E st."] from ["Downtown"], E turns into Richards, and then Richards turns into Cowell.
