Outdoor Adventures is the closet thing to an outdoors club at UCD. It is however a business run by students. That means it costs money to go on trips. And no, you can't get units. Students do get cheaper prices on everything than the general public or "university affiliates". They offer various trips every weekend as well as certain types of night classes and longer trips during vacation periods. They also have a great rental center where you can rent most types of equipment that you'd need to do one of the trips on your own. They don't rent downhill skis or snowboards though. 

OA trips are usually TONS of fun if you didn't already know.

Trips:
 * Rafting
 * Whitewater kayaking
 * Sea kayaking
 * ["Backpacking"]
 * Showshoeing
 * Cross country skiing
 * Rock Climbing
 * Fly fishing
 * Wilderness photography

Classes:
 * CPR
 * Wilderness First Aid
 * Wilderness First Responder
 * EMT - Emergency Medical Technician
 * Orienteering
 * Fly tying

If you're already experienced at an activity and want some more advanced training or if you want to become a guide for OA then be sure to check out one of the Guide Schools. They offer them once a year for each discipline. 

Registration is available [http://campusrec-registration.ucdavis.edu/ online].
