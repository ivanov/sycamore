The Hot Sauces of Davis:

 * '''["Sriracha"]''' - A popular condiment with ["pho"] and is put it into anything spicy at ["Fuzio"].  The most popular brand of Sriracha is Chinese/Vietnamese and made by the Huy Fong company.  But there are others.  Sriracha can often be found at any ["Dining Commons"].
 * '''["Tabasco"]''' - Many Varieties of the Louisiana Hot Sauce are available throughout Davis
  * '''Chipotle Tabasco''' - This can be found at ["Chipotle"] of all places.  It is more mild than regular Tabasco, but has a rich, roasted flavor and is spicier in the aftertaste than it is going down.
  * '''Green Tabasco''' - Also known as Jalapeno Tabasco, is the mildest and perhaps the most flavorful of Tabasco.  
  * '''Habanera Tabasco''' - Is mostly for burning your mouth, and was last spotted at ["Crepeville" Crêpeville].
  * '''Regular Tabasco''' - Used in ["Bloody Mary" Bloody Marys], is plentiful at ["Breakfast" breakfast] spots, and rich in tradition and vinegar.
 * '''Tapatio''' - Perhaps the most stolen bottle of hot sauce in Davis.
 * '''Cholula''' - Nice wooden caps.
 * '''[http://www.wingtime.com Wing Time Buffalo Wing Sauces]''' - A whole slew of hot wing sauces, made right here in Davis.
 * '''The Pepper Plant''' - A thick, California-style hot sauce from Gilroy, CA. Available at ["Pluto's"]. It's great on the fries!

 * '''["Frank's Red Hot"] Buffalo Sauce''' - ["Jack in the Box"] - ''Ask for it with anything you order.  It's very useful.''
 * '''["KFC Hot Sauce"]''' - A special hot sauce prepared by the Colonel himself for use at ["KFC" Kentucky Fried Chicken].  Next time you're there, check lifelike statuary art, "The Colonel Sits on the Bench."
 * '''["Border Sauce"]''' - ["Taco Bell"], a "wannabe Mexican" chain, provides little packets of "Fire" sauce, their hottest hot sauce, which are considered mild by anyone who has ever had any ''real'' hot sauce.
 * '''["Del Scorcho"]''' - ["Del Taco"] ... Much better than "Fire Sauce," but still not the liquid ulcer hot sauce aficionados dream of.

== Pedrick ==

 Enter ["Pedrick Produce"], head to the back wall, turn right and walk straight.  You will then encounter a wall full of every hot sauce known to humanity.  Everything from "Scorched Buttplug" to "Hillary's Hotlips" (many political sauces) to "Puckered Asshole" to all the varieties of Tabasco and popular rubs like Tony Catchetore's hot spices.  It is truly an epic experience for the hot sauce afficionado. 

==Hot Sauces Consumed In, but Not Necessarily Available In Davis:==
'''If these are available in town, say where.'''

 * '''Dave's Insanity Sauce''' - This stuff really *is* insanely hot! The flavor isn't great though… a red sauce kinda on the vinegarey side. As a fairly well-seasoned veteran of hot sauces, I wouldn't recommend more than a drop or two at the absolute most until you figure out what you can handle. One friend swore it permanently damaged her taste buds.
   * ''I'm pretty sure I've seen it at Pedricks.  Look low, where all the "contains mostly capasian" sauces are.  Lots of black or "burned" cardboard boxes.'' -- ["JabberWokky"]
 * '''Valentina''' - For that "sabor autentico".  Comes in regular, hot, and extra hot. Its yummy on eggs and beans...really anything. (except cereal)
 * '''XXX Calypso Hot''' - I think I ordered this stuff online from a place in Louisiana the year I tried to make gator chili; looks like the sauce is made in the Tortolas, BVI though.  It's a red sauce with a bonnet pepper base. Nice texture with chunks of pepper seed, but a bit 'thick'. Definitely one of the hotter ones I've tried. Not too much vinegar and not nearly as hot as Dave's Insanity Sauce; I'd recommend starting with just a few drops to be safe.
   * ''In the "it's a small world" category, I met the woman who makes that the last time I went down to the Virgin Islands.  There are a dozen or so good hot sauce companies down there, and it's one of their few exports.'' -- ["JabberWokky"]
