Poker playing had become so prevelant in the ["Dorms" dorms] that at one point some ["Freshman" freshmen] were heard to be losing $50-100 a day in ["Thompson Hall"] in ["Segundo"]. Since then, flyers were posted mentioning the illegality of gambling, and ["Resident Advisors" RAs] were told to crack down on students playing poker for money. The poker playing hasn't stopped, though it has become more secretive: most ["Freshman" freshmen] result in going over to the ["Cuarto Residence Halls"] to play.||

''2005-01-26 18:34:00'' [[nbsp]] Poker and other card games where the house has no "bank" aren't illegal in the state of California.  You do need a license to collect table fees like an over-18 Poker room does, however. --["ScottRitchie"]

''2005-01-26 20:33:49'' [[nbsp]] However, it is important to note that what is permissible on campus is not governed by simple legality, especially when it comes to the Residence Halls. If you are over 21, that doesn't allow you to consume alcohol on campus, for example. Similarly, gambling is normally not permitted on University grounds. --["ElvinLee"]
