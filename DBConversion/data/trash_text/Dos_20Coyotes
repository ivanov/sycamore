The North Davis location (the original) is still somewhat better than the South Davis location in terms of quality and size of portions.  The variety of salsas is sizeable, with options ranging from guacamole-based to old standbys like pico de gaillo.  The quality of meat used is quite good, though ordering steak will incur a small extra charge.  Choose this place if you're looking for southwestern-style food, rather than traditional Mexican food.  Their daily specials can be very interesting, and this restaurant provides several seafood and vegetarian options -- they are particulary famous for their immense salads. (For other immense salads see ["Pluto's"])

''The dogs on the [http://www.doscoyotes.net/home.html main site] looked to be having fun so I thought I'd give this restaurant a try. Sadly, I forgot that dogs will eat about anything, even their own poo. I was invited along to Dos with an e-friend. Wandering in, it seemed like a pretty neat place to sit down and grab some food. But its only good for maybe sitting down and getting a drink. The burriotes there are awful! A taint to the name of tex-mex cuisine. Okay, so it doesn't have any lard or MSG...but I'd rather have my mouth orgasm with delight than gag at the attempts of healthy food.'' -- ["JasminCamacho"]

''I think it's fairly tasty, actually.  But it's not Mexican.'' -- ["ChrisTakemura"]

''I think the food is generally quite good, but really more southwest than tex-mex.  (Where's the chili, huh?)  Excellent salsas.  Too bad they skimp on the chips.'' -- ["JaimeRaba" jr]

''I'm quite enamoured of their chicken ranchero burrito a la carte with extra cheese on top.  Mmm mmm good.  Their massive salads, unfortunately, don't make up for taste with stunningly large volume -- stay away.'' -- ["PaulLanzi" Paul]

''Just get the shrimp burrito and be happy!'' -- ["NAM TURK" NxTx]
