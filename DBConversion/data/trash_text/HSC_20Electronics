If you are a real hardware geek, into HAM radio and obscure server racks, HSC is the place for you.  Dusty bins of resistors, semi-working wiggle scopes and project boxes adorn simple shelves.  There is no place in Davis like it, so the 25 mile trip up I-80 to Madison is an occasional pilgrimage for those who think Fry's is way too mainstream.

If you like this place, you may also like ["Surplus Stuff"], which is somewhat more computer-oriented.

Directions: Right on Madison, head east to the Strings Restaurant, turn right onto College Oak, up to Amber Lane, and right into the parking lot.  It is not well labeled - if you cross Auburn (on Madison or on College Oak), you've gone too far.
