Larry Vanderhoef is the chancellor of ["UC Davis"].

Vanderhoef was born in Minnesota and grew up in Wisconsin.  He got his [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science BS] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%27s_degree MS] degrees in biology at U of Wisonsin.

He proceeded to serve on the faculties of several universities, until in 1984 he became the executive vice chancellor of UC Davis and the one-person governing board of the UCD Medical Center.  Subsequently he absorbed the additional titles of acting vice chancellor for academic affairs and acting vice chancellor for research and, in 1991, provost (these titles held simultaneously, mind you).  In 1994 he was named chancellor of UC Davis.

Vanderhoef is a member of ["Sword and Sandals"], but appears reluctant about it (at least in [http://www-ucdmag.ucdavis.edu/fall96/Feature/Feature_Sword.html this source]), and has received the Anti-Defamation League's Distinguished Community Service Award.  In his twenty years here at Davis he has not heard anything about ["Cow Tipping" cow tipping], but is looking into it.

Much of this taken from his [http://chancellor.ucdavis.edu/chancellor.cfm official bio].

In January of 2005, ["The California Aggie"] ran a feature on Vanderhoef's typical day in this[http://www.californiaaggie.com/article/?id=7225 article].  
   ''- I am the anonymous student in the article. -["JackHaskel"]''

''I sat by him once at the ["Mondavi Center"] for the ["University Symphony Orchestra"] fall performance and he happened to clap at the wrong time, so I guess he doesn't know much about classical music.'' -["RohiniJasavala"]

''If you try to go to his office, on the fifth floor of ["Mrak Hall"], his secretary will promptly kick you out unless you have a damn good excuse.  I know this because I tried.  Oh, and the fifth floor has some nice furniture in the waiting room, which you'll never get a chance to sit in.''  - ["BrentLaabs"]

He kind of resembles Dick Cheney but without the sideways smirk.

Rumor is that Larry has a 2 million dollar slush fund that he can use at any given time, but it is only a rumor from past ASUCD Senators who knew him very well.
