By day a head clerk at Safeway, but by night.. he's LAMARMAN!  No that was a lie.  Actually he is a clerk at Safeway by day AND night, including every holiday.  Despite this, he still manages to be a linguistics grad student at UC Davis, a columnist for ["California Aggie" the Aggie], AND recently ran for ["City Council"].  He has the unique distinction of having a major controversy named after him - ["Lamargate"].  Incidently, as an Aggie columnist, he isn't allowed to have an opinion about ["ASUCD"] politics, to the point that they won't actually allow him to use the word "Lamargate" in his column.  All in all Lamar Heystek is a brilliant individual.  ["KrisFricke" Kris Fricke]'s girlfriend thinks he has a ["mancrush"] on Lamar since upon entering the ["North Davis"] ["Safeway"] Kris always looks about for Lamar immediately, much like a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meercat meercat].


Also Lamar is dutch, has a twin brother (who is on the board of education in his own respective location), and his father is at least as funny as he is.
