Unbeknownst to most students, there is a barber shop in the ["Memorial Union" MU] basement! (among other things). Go to the bowling alley and take the corridor to the far left of the lanes back, then turn right.

Call ahead for reservations.  Walk-ins are possible, but [http://www.dateline.ucdavis.edu/dl_detail.lasso?id=7433 John Salido], the proprietor, is usually pretty booked.  John is knowledgeable in just about everything but is in the upper echelon of barbering in that he doesn't make you feel uncomfortable if you don't want to engage in small talk whilst getting your [http://www.geocities.com/RodeoDrive/3696/Photos_mh.html mohawk] tightened up.

In addition to being a craftsman and artist with regard to his job, John is also an amazing source of information about the campus.

''Funny you should say that (whomever wrote the above), because I DO always use the University Haircutters for my mohawkin needs.. he'll even give you mohawk maintenance advice (don't use conditioner, etc..).  If someone wants a picture of John cutting a mohawk (and I think that would be cool), I'll be in there gettin hawked sometime early next week (5th, Nov - 9 Nov 2004).'' -["KrisFricke"]
