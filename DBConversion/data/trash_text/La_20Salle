This apartment complex features a pool, spa, and laundry room.  It also has a nice courtyard area for having barbecues.  The laundry room here is special as it does not take quarters.  It will a credit card or debit card and create an "account" with it for you.  No more grubbing for quarters!  The management is very stingy here when it came to getting your deposit back.  Unless your apartment looks like you just bought a new house, dont expect to get much back.
