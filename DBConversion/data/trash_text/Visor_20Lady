Visor lady roams, er I mean waddles, the campus with plastic ["UC Davis Bookstore"] bags. She is one of the ["Town Characters"]. She is mostly seen in the ["Coffee House"], eating a slice of pizza or breadstick.  Her nickname is due to her green visor that she wears.

No one knows where she lives, but she rents a bowling alley locker every year, not for a bowling ball as you'd expect but to hold books!

Rumor says that she works for the music department. Doing what? No idea. The ["California Aggie"] is rumored to have banned their reporters from doing articles about her. Another rumor is that she is some kind of genius due to an event where she rambled on about atmospheric science to one, Tony, a ["Coffee House"] student manager.

 * I've seen her working on music before in ["Griffin Lounge"]. Also seen many other strange things but I'll respect her privacy. - ["JackHaskel"]

 * Almost every Monday and Wednesday evening (around 6pm) I see her in the lobby of the music building. I think she sticks around there to listen to the various ensembles practice. -["Stacie Townsend"]

 * I happened to be browsing the children's books at the UCD Bookstore one early morning and the visor lady was at the back counter TALKING.  She was ordering a children's book from the lady and thanked her kindly.  The sales representative said (after the lady left) "You know, it took her months to be that nice to me. I once touched her hand and she went ballistic..."-["JenndelaVega"]

 * I saw Visor Lady walking down Chestnut Street in San Francisco on Chirstmas Eve 2004. She was even carrying her signature ["UC Davis Bookstore"] shopping bags. - ["JackHaskel"]

 * I once was on campus very early in the morning (around 6:30 am) and saw Visor Lady walking across one of the ["Putah Creek"] pathways in the ["Arboretum"], back behind the music building, headed towards the ["Memorial Union"].  I totally did a double-take because I had only ever seen her around the MU.  I wonder where in Davis she lives.  --["KayRide"]  

 * I saw her at the Amtrak station in Richmond, CA in the fall of 2003. She wore her infamous green visor and carried a ["UC Davis Bookstore"] bag. There were no books in it. I think she was on her way back to Davis after spending the day in Berkeley. I'm not sure why I believe this. Call it a hunch. -["GracielaGuardado"]
