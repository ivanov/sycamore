Being a valued institution of research and learningsment, the University of California, Davis is in a state of constant change and flux. Indeed, some say UCD stands for Under Construction Daily. To keep explorers of the University informed of this fact, the kind fellows in its administration often feel it necessary to erect gigantic colorful signs in front of future construction projects.

The construction comes with a cost to students: ["Closed Bike Paths"], detours and alternate routes.

These signs generally include a brief description of the widget to be built, along with a dollar figure of how much the project is costing the University (at least, how much it cost at the time they put down the sign). Sometimes they even have sassy concept art. 

Though many of the signs advertise a web site ([http://growthplanning.ucdavis.edu]) with news articles related to Campus growth, this site gives no indication of how many construction projects are currently going on, nor even '''how many of these delightful signs have been placed'''. No one has stepped up to fill this void. UNTIL NOW.

They also provide a colorful [http://www.ae.ucdavis.edu/aehome.nsf/ActiveConstructionMap?OpenNavigator map of current campus projects.]

''I have the following complaints about the Davis Campus: (1) The single worst thing is the absolute absense of overall design and planning. Hardly any buildings actually match each other architecturally and you end up with a grab-bag of funky buildings plopped right next to each other. (2) The Campus needs to consolidate instead of continually sprawling outward. (3)This one really isn't the designers/architects fault, but it would have been cool to incorporate some natural area like the arborteum running threw campus inbetween the buildings.'' -["JamesDawe"]
 * ''The architectural schizophrenia is, I think, a feature of the UC system in general. UCSB certainly has the same issues, while UCSD and Berkeley seem to have it somewhat as well. Can't speak for the others. Speaking of the arboretum, since Putah Creek in the arboretem seems to have no relation to the original Putah creek, I don't see why it can't just be extended into and through campus. In fact, maybe we could make a canal system that runs through campus. That would be awesome: Davis could become "The Venice of the West". It wouldn't be too much more out of place than a division I athletic program anyway.'' -["EricKlein"]
