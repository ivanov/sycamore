One of the fanciest restaurants in the nearby area, the Buckhorn is modeled after a hunting lodge.  If you or your companion can't stand the thought of eating in a room decorated with the trophy heads, this is not the place for you.

A typical date for two will generally run about $70, which is an excellent deal for the high quality food and atmosphere.  It is an excellent place for an anniversary or similar celebration.  The owner walks the room and remembers customers.

The menu varies from visit to visit and often features fresh game.  

Advance reservations are highly recommended.
