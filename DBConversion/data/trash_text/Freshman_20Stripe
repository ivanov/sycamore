Being new to the campus, ["Freshmen"] do not always equip their ["Bicycles" bicycles] with fenders in time for the rainy season. Once the first rain begins, the backwheel of unfendered bicycles hurls a stripe of mud upon the rider's back. Hence, the "Freshman Stripe".

A possible solution for the freshman stripe, for those too lazy/cheap to buy fenders:
Use a waterproof jacket. That way when the mud flies onto it, it will be easy to wash off with the rain conveniently pouring down upon you at the same time. 

Or you could avoid the puddles. All of them.
