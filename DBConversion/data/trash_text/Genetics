The genetics program at UCD covers a classical genetics approach and a more molecular based approach to give students a good well rounded view of the field.  The major was restructured in 2004, and the requirements were trimmed in some areas.

Genetics core courses are offered through the ["Molecular and Cellular Biology" MCB] department in the ["Biological Sciences" Division of Biological Sciences].
