Hoagland Hall is the home of the ["Atmospheric Science"] department, as well at the Environmental Health and Safety office.  It is a relatively small hall, only two stories with an even mix of classes, labs, and offices.  It is on the west end of campus, just south of the ["On Campus Co-Ops" Co-Ops] and north of ["Hutchison Hall"].  Immediately to the west of Hoagland Hall lies the Hoagland Annex, a former garage converted to offices for graduate students.  The wooded area to the south of Student Housing is affectionately referred to as "Lake Hoagland" during the rainy season, as it frequently floods.

There is not much of interest at Hoagland Hall, except for the fact that the ROTC Armory is kept in the basement.  Coincedentally, the ["Students for an Orwellian Society"] happen to hold their secret meetings at Hoagland Hall.

= History =
Hoagland Hall is named after Dennis Robert Hoagland, who was a Professor of Agricultural Chemistry and Soil Science.  The ["Soil Science"] department used to occupy the building along with the rest of the department of ["Land, Air, and Water Resources"], but they have since moved on to the ["Plant and Environmental Sciences Building"].  Some soil samples still live on the south side of the hall, if anyone is interested.
