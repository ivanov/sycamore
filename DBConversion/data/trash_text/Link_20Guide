== When to link ==
Link to a page only when you know you're going to make the page soonish.  It's okay to have links to nowhere, but in general we should avoid this. 

So, when you make a page, say ["Central Park"], you should do a search to see what pages refer to "central park".  Then change the links on those pages appropriately and reasonably.  This means that you should just use words like "park" liberally and without linking them if the place doesn't exist yet.

If the place does exist, then it's your call whether to link to it when you refer to it.

See also ["Help On Linking"] for how to make links.
