Apartment complex consisting primarily of sophomores, therefore is fittingly called the "sophomore dorms" by some.  It can be noisy, especially on the Portage Bay West side, but also has a lot of parties with ["free beer"].

Commonly referred to as "A-town," as well as the "Black Hole" because many times residents don't venture outside of Arlington to party since there is pretty much always something going on.

Most of the sophomores that live here are affiliated with the greek system and get their apartments passed down.

The east side of Arlington is developing its own nickname called "Farlington" because its on the "other side." You are a "Farlington Shacker" if you shack it with any of the football or basketball boys, henceforth having a lovely ["walk of shame"] the morning after.

It is located on the Unitrans D-line which goes to both the ["Memorial Union"] and ["The Silo"].  

 * Until '01-'02, Arlington was THE party complex.  Then they cracked down.  I heard they paid a police officer to live there and do patrols. --["RishiTrivedi"]
