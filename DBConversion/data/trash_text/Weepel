Weepel is (or was) a Weezer cover band comprised of UC Davis students.  They rocked ["Kleiber Hall"] along with some some other ["Davis Music Scene" DMS] bands of the time.  The great thing about Weepel is that everyone already knows all the lyrics and the songs, so it's basically like listening to one of your favorite bands play.  

''I'm not sure if these guys are still around, but I remeber having some really good times seeing them play in '02'' - ["PhilipNeustrom"]

''This page made my day. Yeah we rocked out a couple times during the 2002-2003 year for kicks. We decided not to go on for various reasons.'' - ["AndrewMatey"]
