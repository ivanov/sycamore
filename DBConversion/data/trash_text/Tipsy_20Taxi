Provides a safe ride home for $1 Thursday through Saturday night stopping at 2am.  The phone number is '''(530) 752-6666''' the line is often busy but if you're persistent you can get through eventually. In theory, it is supposed to be a service for undergraduates but because ["Reg Card"]s are not checked regularly many graduate and non-students use it as well. The goal of Tipsy Taxi is to get students home safely, not to take them from one bar or party to the next. The unit has faced many problems with the city on this issue and so the current policy states that Tipsy Taxi will only pick up and drop off at any authorized ["Unitrans"] bus stop.

While Tipsy Taxi does employ ["Unitrans"] drivers, route supervisors, and personnel it is actually a part of Specialized Transportation Services (STS).
