You know... Kinko's... you go there and make copies and stuff...   They have a great hydraulic cutter, which can cut anything!  Loads of fun at 3am.  They charge a dollar a cut.  So it's cheaper to cut your textbook in half than to make business cards.

They used to give a 20% student discount with UCD ["Reg Card"], but I think that discout has since been cut to 10%.

Also the latest FedEx pickup in town: between 4:45 and 5pm.  Officially, the store is called FedEx Kinko's now.  Go figure.

You can hook your laptop up to their laptop stations (use the Ethernet) and use the internet pretty much indefinitely for free (works best late at night).  Also, charging is sort of hazy on prints made from laptops.

And let's not forget: ["BlairBaldwin" Blair] works at FedEx Kinko's!
