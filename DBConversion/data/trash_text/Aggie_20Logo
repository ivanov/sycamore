The current Aggie Logo was designed in 1999 by a marketing firm called SME Design ([[s(begin)]]http://www.smedesign.com [[s(stop)]]  apparently this is a different firm now.)  The University spent $40,000 on the design of the logo as well as several variants.  This logo now appears on everything from the General Catalog to official letterhead and ["Aggie Pack"] clothing.
