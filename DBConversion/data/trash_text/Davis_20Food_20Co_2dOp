The Davis Food Co-op is a grocery store complete with bulk bins, organic produce and natural foods galore.  Anyone can shop; non-members pay 5% over shelf price. If you volunteer, you get discounts. To join, you need to pay a $5 one time non-refundable membership fee and buy $10 worth of shares and each successive year you need to buy another $20 worth of shares. When you decide to leave Davis, or the Co-op, you can cash out your shares.  If you don't feel like paying the five bucks for the membership card, wait until September when they do new member recruitment.

They have a full deli, with a selection of goodies that changes daily.  Baked goods are made in-house and are awesome.  They also offer an incredible variety of bulk coffee, spices, and loose leaf tea.

Started in a Davis living room in 1972, the Davis Food Co-op has grown into a full-service food cooperative owned and operated by over 7,000 local households.
   We've operated at 620 G Street since March, 1984. In 1990, we were able to buy our building. We renovated and remodeled in 1992 and 1997.
   We're proud to be open seven days a week, from 8 am to 10 pm. (Hours vary on July 4th, Thanksgiving, and around the end of December.) The Co-op provides you with a unique, healthy array of foods that can support many diets: from that of the young family to the nutritional particulars of a special diet; from that of the health-conscious shopper to the person who questions the use of chemical pesticides on their fruit and vegetables.
   Nowhere else in town delivers over 40 different varieties of organic produce every day of the week, features over 750 items in bulk, or naturally-raised, chemical-free beef and chicken.
  But the Davis Food Co-op's most important characteristic is that it is a cooperative. We exist to serve our members, and depend on your support and involvement to exist.

''The Co-op is rad. In addition to being one of the last places to buy groceries downtown, the staff is friendly and helpful and the selection is pretty decent. You'll find yourself eating better if you shop here regularly (I did). My '''only''' complaint about The Co-op would be the occasionally slow checkout lines, but hey, it's retail... they do the best they can with the number of shoppers that plow through the store in the evenings!'' - ["KenNeville"]


''Additionally, if you're a ["Living Cheaply" cheapskate] who happens to like purchasing fresh veggies (like me), and can volunteer a regular four hours per week, you get a 16.5% discount on groceries.'' -["AmeliaCarlson"]
