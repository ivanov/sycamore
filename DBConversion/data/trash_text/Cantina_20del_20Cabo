Cantina del Cabo aka "The Cantina"

= The Bar =

LOTS of Beer. [Someone get a list or take a picture of their list?]

Like most bars in Davis, the ["Decent Well Liquor" well alcohol] is basically headache juice, so remember to specify a brand at a slight up-charge.  

= The Night Scene =

LOTS of ["ass"], especially on Thursday night.  Also somewhat happening after 11pm on Friday and Saturday.

- too bad its all man ass at the "mantina"

= The Restaurant =

The only vestage of its mexican-food past, is chips and salsa and the decor.  Cantina used to be what'd you expect with a name like "Cantina del Cabo" - a campy somewhat tropical-themed mexican restaraunt.  And truthfully it made for a nice place to grab lunch and a margarita.  However, owner and founder ["Tom Lovering"] decided that Cantina should be a steakhouse.  So now Cantina serves steaks.  This is fine, but in a restaurant with neither steakhouse ambiance nor tableclothes, it doesn't really work.

Earth to Tom:  What would work - and be a hybrid of both the Cantina theme and the steakhouse theme - would be to be more like an Islands restaurant.  See, Tom is reputed to be a huge ["Jimmy Buffet"] fan and exclusively wears ["Aloha shirts"].  If he themed the menu with ["Jimmy Buffet"] food and drink items (tropical paradise, remember?), he could have a legitimate reason to serve burgers, latin-infused food and even steak.  (I mean, hey, The Islands chain makes it work.)

If you're going to get food here, the following are surprisingly good:
 * Pesto Pasta
 * Hamburgers
 * Guacamole (although it's not spicy at all)
