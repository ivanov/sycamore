Russell Park is privately owned and managed by Tandem Properties, but is located on land leased from UC Davis. The lease agreement with the university stipulates that apartments at Russell Park be offered to student families before any other type of tenancy is considered. The complex has two playground areas for children, a volleyball and barbecue area, a community room, and some of Davis' most affordable storage rentals.
