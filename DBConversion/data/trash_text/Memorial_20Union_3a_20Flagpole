Sitting right in the middle of the Quad end of the ["Memorial Union"], the flagpole stands. . strong.  The flagpole is usually the place of origin of remembrance walks, protests in the quad, and (of course) various flag ceremonies like raising and lowering the flag (but who pays attention to that?).  Most of us don't notice the flagpole until it's windy -- then the little metal bits attached to the flag-rope hit the pole over and over, creating a spooky "CLINK, CLINK, . . CLINK" sound all throughout east and west quad.  In a way, the flagpole is the social center-of-gravity of the ["Memorial Union"].

While the flagpole isn't too exciting, maybe that's [http://flagpole.mit.edu/ a good thing].
