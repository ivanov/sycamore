Vacaville is west of Davis on I-80, a bit further than ["Dixon"] and larger than ["Dixon"] or ["Woodland"], although not as large as the greater ["Sacramento"] area.  It is handier for certain stores in some cases, and since many of the locations in ["Sacramento"] are well off the freeway, it can be faster to get to Vacaville and back than to Sacramento and back.
