Sponsored by ["The Co-Op" the Davis Food Co-op], the City of Davis, and ["Davis Community Meals"], plus corporate sponsors, Davis sponsors a free holiday meal, usually on the 24th of December at the ["Veterans Memorial Building"].  Food is donated.  Volunteers cook and serve.  Everyone is welcome.  The music is terrific, and guests are invited to take home the leftovers.
