While he did not or had not seen the Davis Wiki at the time this page was orignally created, Rob Roy deserves an entry because he is, quite simply, an integral part of Davis culture and lore.  He is the manager of the ["Ben & Jerry's"] downtown, a DJ on ["KDVS"], and, well, he wears an impressive variety of hats.  But what makes the man a living legend are his insane shenanigans off the clock, not the least of which being drinking a urine/beer mixture and setting his pubes on fire on camera for a ["Robotmedia"] entry.  That, friends, is true immortality.

Rob Roy is [http://www.newsreview.com/issues/sacto/2004-11-04/clubber.asp "famous for two things: lighting his genitals on fire and drinking his own urine,"] according the Sacramento News and Review.

Rob Roy has also been refered to as ["SharonZimmerman"]'s fiancé.

It should also be noted that Rob lives at the ["Pirate Ship"] and in addition to being the ["Party King Of Davis"], Rob Roy is an accomplished and active poet.  Most notably, he runs ["Write Club"].  There is, of course, an [http://www.writeclub.net official Write Club site]. 

Below is one of Rob's poems, lifted from the ["Write Club"] site.

=== "UC Davis Quad in March, 2003" ===
(Taken from the ["Write Club"] site)

{{{These two green rectangles fixed 
parallel to make a square, 
a fresh-air July oven, 
or a giant January puddle. 

This is the Tiananmen Square of California, 
hollowed ground of revolutionary ideas - 
framed by overflowing bike racks 
and blessed with immigrants 
that may still have air breathed in Asia 
not yet exhaled from their lungs. 

This emerald El Dorado of Atzlan, 
a lunch time dining spot where Tex Mex burritos 
that are formed and served by the children 
of Anglo accountants and Asian engineers 
are consumed as quickly as the pace of globalization 
by the children of Anglo engineers and Asian accountants. 
The Chicanos eat along, counting their French fries 
until there are none, and forget 
that the Mayans first realized the number zero. 

Upon human chests, a Taj Mahal of gold 
and blue school spirit is erected; 
as our pride gallops as a noble mustang 
through this golden state prairie of higher education. 

Huddles, and groups, and bunches 
of people gathered and placed 
by the arbitration of the laws of personal space, 
as if replicating the boundaries that form the nations of Africa. 
A continent of dialects within these few acres of land. 

Of these two separate rectangles, 
the west is for Israel 
and the east is for Palestine. 
This lunchtime Jerusalem separated, not 
by a barbed wired fence, but a four-foot wide walkway. 
A Gaza Strip of concrete 
surrounded by a Mosque of shade (pointing to Mecca), 
a synagogue of shade (building a kissing wall of cool air), 
a cathedral of shade (with tree branches casting a shadow of a crucifix), 
and the sunlight, glowing like eternal springtime Zen, 
heats the grass and the breeze 
so they are as warm as blood pumping in veins.}}} 

More of his poetry can be found on [http://www.writeclub.net/home/id13.html his Write Club page].

''2004-07-02 14:28:21'' [[nbsp]] Upon my intense freshman Sping quarter at UCD, I had witnessed the crotch burning antics, poetry reading (Rob yelling, DADDY FUCKED ME) on the quad..various themed parties and seeing this man at his highs and lows. He is truly the party king of Davis. He allows us to out-party and shame all other University communities. His faith in people, such as myself makes him that much better and a good friend of mine. He has heart and the keys to Ben and Jerry's. Rob Roy is THE man. - ["JenndelaVega"]
