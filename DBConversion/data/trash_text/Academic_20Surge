Academic Surge has the good luck of having one of the weirdest building names on campus. That being said, the building itself is fairly plain, aside from the architect having an odd industrial fetish.

[http://www.cevs.ucdavis.edu/vs_pages/vtour/slides/slide_academicsurge.htm Academic Surge] is located on the south side of Engineering III (which is near Kemper Hall, for those not familiar w/ Eng. III).

This building hosts (at least) the following:
  *[http://www.idav.ucdavis.edu/ Institute for Data Visualization and Analysis] (IDAV, formerly known as CIPIC)
  *[http://www.its.ucdavis.edu/ Institute for Transportation Studies]
  *[http://education.ucdavis.edu/ School of Education]
  *[http://bohart.ucdavis.edu/ Museum of Entomology]
  *One very odd (usually broken) ice cream vending machine
  *A very high concentration of late night grad students
