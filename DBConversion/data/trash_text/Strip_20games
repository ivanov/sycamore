Strip Games are games which are designed to cause players to be in various states of undress.  Players are often given a choice of taking a shot or getting naked.  The end result is usually the same.  See also ["Naked games"] and ["Drinking games"].

 * Strip Truth or Dare
 * Strip Jenga
 * Strip 'I Never'
 * Strip Monopoly - (give players only $200 dollars to start with, but each article of clothing is worth a certain amount.  Underwear is worth more than a sweater, and must be taken off in order.)
 * Strip Twister - This may be how you were conceived!
 * Strip ["Poker"] - Ahh.  The timeless classic.
 * Strip Blackjack - For people who don't know all the rules to poker.
 * Strip DDR/Pump It Up - A game that will never exist outside of ["TravisGrathwell"]'s most ridiculous fantasies.
