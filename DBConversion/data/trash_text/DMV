Everybody's favorite bureaucracy. Even its hours of operation are convoluted.

The Davis DMV has recently implemented a very-much-desired computer system for tracking waiting clients.  Before, all the windows dealt with every customer request, and when you'd go in, you'd just take a paper number from the wheel and sit and wait for HOURS until they call you.  NOW when you walk in they have a nifty scrolling marquee which not only tells you current wait time, but also the current wait time at other DMV's nearby (["West Sacramento"], etcetera).  Then you go to a triage-like window where they ask you what your business is, and then give you a printed-out number for the corresponding window.  Lastly, your number and window is announced over the loudspeaker, so if you go outside for some reason, you won't miss your place in line.  

It is still highly reccommended that you make an appointment for any business you might have with the DMV, which can be done over the phone or through the incredibly easy-to-use website (above).
