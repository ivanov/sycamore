The Domes are a cooperative living community, made up of a series of fiberglass domes. They look like ["The Hobbit" hobbit houses], and are located in an area called ["Baggins End"] at the western end of Orchard Park Road, off of La Rue. This is ["Hoopies" Hoopie] heaven.

''Someone should put some real info here about the domes and the co-op community there.''

The domes have their own [http://thedomes.org website].
