He actually used to be a professional musician and teacher until things went all wrong.

Now he is an old drunk that resembles Charles Bukowski but with frizzier hair. Guitar in hand, he frequents ["Downtown"], mostly on G street in front of ["Woodstock's Pizza" Woodstocks]. The odds are he has asked you for change. If you ask him to play a song, it will be well worth the dollar tossed in his direction.

''2005-01-07 19:03:10'' [[nbsp]] He truly is an excellent guitar player.  He's provided entertainment during many-an-evening, especially around Little Prague.  And even though I probably wasn't helping him, I've gladly thrown some change his way.  He's a value-added begger.  Most people just ask for change and tell you some lie.  This guy is honest and talented. --["JaimeRaba"]
