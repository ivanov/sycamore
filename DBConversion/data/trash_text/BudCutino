Davis loves Bud Cutino.  He can be considered a transient, and has set up camp in the ["Garage People" garage] in ["720"].  Originally from San Diego, he has lived in a number of places, including London and Portland.  Everywhere he goes, he spreads love, fun, and clever conversation.

Bud is a massage therapist by profession.  He's also a writer on the side.

He probably seems like he's too cool for you, but if you ever see him around, do yourself a favor and say hello.  He'll charm your face off.

Bud really knows how to chat up the ladies.
