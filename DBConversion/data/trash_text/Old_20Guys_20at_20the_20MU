There are two old men that hang out at the very center of the ["MU"] nearly every day. Right by the entrance to the section of the ["Coffee House"] that has a piano. One old man always has on a fishing hat and the other one is bald. Rumor has it from ["GarySaylin"] that one of them is an emeritus art professor. Apparently they are two ["Town Characters"] that are worth talking to.
