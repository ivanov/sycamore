The premise:  ''One man's garbage is another man's treasure.''

Dumpster diving is the Davis form of recycling. Many businesses and school organizations throw out wonderful things. Also on ["Moving Day"] in ["Davis"] dumpster diving is practically a civic duty.

Here is how you do it. Find a dumpster, climb in, and search for something useful.

 ''You could feed the world with my garbage dump. That sums it up in one big lump. - Charles Manson (an old school Dumpster Diver)''

Some amazing things can be found in dumpsters in this town. Many of the grocery stores regularly throw away perfectly good food (some of which is then eaten at ["Whole Earth Festival"] meetings).
  * A friend of mine once found a live, large tarantula still in it's plastic tank. Some jerk apparently decided to just throw the furry guy away. - ["DanMasiel"]

Dumpster diving early and often can help furnish your apartment! Don't pay for furniture that might get ruined quickly.  Items as large as couches and as small as wall art are often found in dumpsters at ["Moving Day" end of August/beginning of September].

= Good Dumpsters =
 * ["Anderson Plaza"] dumpsters often have expired food and occasional videos. Dinner and a date!
 * The dumpster behind ["Borders"] often has stripped books.
 * The dumpster behind ["Tower Records"] has stripped porno mags.
 * There are a lot of dumpsters on ["Campus"].
 * The [http://pom.ucdavis.edu/ Department of Pomology's] compost bin between ["Wickson Hall"] and ["Wellman Hall"] is usually filled to the brim with fresh fruits and nuts. Most of it has been experimented on so beware.
   * Hardcore, man.  --["ChrisTakemura" ct]

''2005-01-31 01:01:03'' [[nbsp]] Though you might have to compete with a small but sometimes territorial homeless population in Davis, I recommend checking out liquor store dumpsters. Many treasures to be found for the cash strapped student or underager (I do not endorse underage drinking). But FYI liquor store dumpsters are also known as urinals. --["ErnBro"]
