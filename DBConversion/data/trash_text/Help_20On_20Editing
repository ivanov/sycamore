== Page Editing ==

The following pages describe the elements (wiki markup) you can use to get special formatting effects:
 * ["Help On Formatting"] - general text formatting rules
 * ["Help On Linking"] - external hyperlinks and inline images
 * ["Help On Headlines"] - section headings
 * ["Help On Rules"] - horizontal rules
 * ["Help On Lists"] - lists and indented sections
 * ["Help On Tables"] - tables

To experiment with wiki markup, go to the ["Wiki Sand Box"] and then click on the Edit tab on the top of the page. Use your browser's "open a new window with this link" feature on the word "Wiki Sand Box", so you can keep the help pages open side-by-side to the editing window.
