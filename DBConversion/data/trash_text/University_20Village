University Village (formerly Sterling) is an apartment complex a decent ways East of ["Campus"], on Cantrill Dr. off 5th St., very close to ["Greystone"] and the police station.

Sterling had a (deserved) reputation for being a party-heavy apartment complex, which was not helped when a [http://www.californiaaggie.com/article/?id=3674 god damn riot] broke out there during the weekend Picnic Day 2004.

Rumor has it that a change in management was the reason for the name change.  It is unknown whether this bureaucratic change has anything to do with the riots and parties etc.
