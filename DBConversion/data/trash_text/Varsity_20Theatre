The Varsity Theater is a large theater that plays host to various performances throughout the year.  Dressed in the art deco style of bygone years, it recently underwent a $200,000 rennovation.  

The ["Davis Musical Theatre Co."] produces 12 musicals a year at the theater.

The annual ["Citizens Who Care"] concerts also take place at the theater.
