More or less a traditional Italian restaurant with the requisite Italian kitsch hanging on the walls. They offer booth dining and plenty of parking. The service is great and the meals fly out of the kitchen hot and fresh in almost no time. 

They have an extensive breakfast menu and were voted "Best Breakfast in Yolo County" by some magazine.
 
All dinner orders come with four slices of delicious garlic bread. 

The draw (haha): tables lined with white paper and a can of crayons. The servers have mastered the fine art of writing their name upside down on the edge of the tables during introduction. Abstract masterpieces can erupt while waiting for your order, so can memories of the best time ever spent in school: kindergarten. 

Good place for a relaxed date as the lights are kept comfortably dim.

Takeout is also an option.

Dinner is consistently awesome. The portions are fairly large. I recommend the Chicken Fettuccini which is served with red bell peppers and a spicy cream sauce. - ["LenaGranik"]

My personal favorite dish is the Kaboom (Angel hair pasta, red bell peppers, tomatoes, sweet corn, and chicken in a yummy tomato cream sauce), but I'm a wimp for spice so I order it "Mild".  -["KayRide"]

------I wholeheartedly second the opinion about the crayons. Many a mural have I left behind in my years here. - ["KenNeville"]

------Wow, I work at Caffe and it is so nice to see consistently positive comments.  Behind the scenes, of course, we are not a smoothly running machine but rather a disorganized, chaotic mess.  By all means, come in for either breakfast or dinner! -["KayRide"]------
