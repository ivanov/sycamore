In January 2002 it snowed in Davis.  If you remember the snow, post your snow memories here!

''That morning I rode my scooter ["Downtown"] from the dorms to go to work.  The road was so slippery that on a sharp turn I nearly low-sided and had to put my foot down.  The sight of snow on the palm trees around Davis was really weird, too.'' - ["MikeIvanov" Mike Ivanov]

''I can't believe I don't have any pictures. My roommate and I both remembered the last time it had snowed in Davis some 9 or 10 years previously -- we grabbed an old snowboard and tried to slide down our apartment's entry stairs, but concrete is death for wet snow like that.'' - ["KenNeville"]

''I slept straight through it and heard in the afternoon that it had snowed.  (It's not a very good story, is it?)'' --["ChrisTakemura" ct]

'' My Snow Memory:  I wake up to people yelling and being noisy outside of my dorm.  I had an early class that morning, so I get up anyway and I'm in the bathroom when my friends rush in and yell stuff.  I can't pee and talk at the same time so I get grumpy.  I've seen snow before.  Bah Humbug! '' - ["RohiniJasavala" Ro]
