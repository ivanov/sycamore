Doug LaMalfa (R-Richvale), first elected in 2002, is a State Assemblyman who represents the 2nd Assembly District of California. He currently is the Vice-Chair of the Assembly Natural Resources Commitee.

Prior to holding public office, Asm. LaMalfa was a founding director of the California Rice Commission from Butte County. He earned his Bachelors Degree in Ag/Business from Cal-Poly

LaMalfa does not represent the city of Davis in his district. However, his district includes the sparsely populated portion of northern Yolo County, which leans to the Republicans in voter registration. A peculiar aspect of this district (as seen in Congressman Mike Thompson’s district) the 2nd Assembly District stretches from Yolo County all the way to the Oregon border. Somehow, legislators feel that Yolo County is politically connected to Modoc and Siskiyou county.
