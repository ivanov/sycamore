Davis the bunny was originally named Mavis becasue his owner, ["DeannaBrusco"] thought he was a female. Later, when he started humping everything in sight, she realized he was a male. She named him Davis because it rhymed and she didn't want to give him a complex. 

Davis loves to chew on all of Deanna's clothes, her cords, and recently chewed up her comforter. He likes to eat pizza, cheese-its, and carrots.
