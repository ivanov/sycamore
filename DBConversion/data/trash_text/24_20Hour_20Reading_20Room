||24 hours a day!||


The 24 hour reading room (officially known as the "Extended Hours Reading Room", but nearly never referred to as such) is probably the coldest and most uninviting place to study on campus; however, it is open 24 hours a day.  There's almost guaranteed seating with the rows and rows of tables and chairs and you're guaranteed to not fall asleep with the bright lights.  The major drawbacks are how much it echoes and how often other users are not quiet. There are also stations connected to campus internet and electrical outlets so it's laptop friendly too!  It does have a group study room and an auditory study room so there isn't a lot of loud talking that goes on.

If you're going to study in the 24 hour reading room I would recommend head phones or some other means of blocking out the echoes of coughs and sneezes.

The previous version of the 24-hour reading room was known as "the Undergrad" (NOT a jr. version of ["The Graduate" The Grad], which you can find over at University Mall), short for "The Undergraduate Reading Room." It was on the south side of the library, and the staircase leading down to the entrance is still there. When ["Shields Library" Shields] was renovated and the western end of the library was added, the Undergrad was converted for other purposes. Back in the day, the Undergrad was equally as uninteresting as today's version.
