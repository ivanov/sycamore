Hi!  My name is Sheila.  Some time ago, I was living with some guy who lived outside all the time, but then some policemen came and took him away and I didn't have anybody to take care of me.  They took me to the ["Yolo County Animal Shelter" Yolo County SPCA].  They called me "Appleberry," and they put me in this little cage.  I tried to be happy, but I sure missed somebody to be my very own person.

Then one day some people came to look at me and they brought me home to their house.

It seemed like a nice place.  They let me sleep in their bed and they took me to the ["Dog Park"] where I met other dogs like me.

They take me to ["Petco"] and get me fun toys and yummy treats.  I think I've found a permanent home with these people, and I am a very happy dog.
