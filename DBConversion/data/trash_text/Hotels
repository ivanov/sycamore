There are a number of hotels in Davis that are convenient for travelers passing through on ["Interstate 80"], visiting parents, visiting scholars or ["Picnic Day"] guests. A partial list:
 * ["University Bed and Breakfast"]
 * ["Davis Bed and Breakfast"]
 * ["Holiday Inn Express"]
 * ["Aggie Inn"]
 * ["Best Western"] (University Suites, and Palm Court)
 * ["Hallmark Inn"]

For the ["Whole Earth Festival"], the ["Hippies"] just seem to sleep in their vans/busses, and booth owners sleep in their booths. Nevertheless, I'm sure the hotels get a lot of business that weekend as well.
