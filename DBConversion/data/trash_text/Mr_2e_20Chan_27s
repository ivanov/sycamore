Mr. Chan's is a small fast food restaurant located just off campus near the ["Death Star"]. The food is pretty greasy and features the basics: beef & broccoli, sweet & sour pork, fried rice, chow mein, etc.  However, it's really inexpensive and the owners are friendly.

For something quick and filling, this place is okay, but if you have time to enjoy good food, eat at ["Orange Hut"] instead.

Don't mind giving out a ton of personal information to shadey credit card people?  Then you might be able to catch a "Free Lunch" here when the goonies are out.
