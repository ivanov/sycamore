Ben & Jerry's from the out side: [[BR]] attachment:outsidebenjer.jpg


Is there anything better for dealing with the hot summer weather in Davis than a delicious Ben & Jerry's ice cream or frozen yogurt sundae in a freshly baked waffle cone?  Damn, now I want some ice cream.  Davis legend ["RobRoy"] is the manager. 

 * Every ["Ben & Jerry's: Third Wednesday" third wednesday] of the month Ben & Jerry's gives 40 percent of its total sales to a charity. Mark that on your calander! Coming up on March 19th Ben & Jerry's is having a ["Ben & Jerry's: Vermonster Challenge" Vermonster Challenge], a benefit for the American Red Cross and their massive tsunami aid effort.

And even if it ain't a hot summer day it is a proven fact that ice  cream in the cold makes you feel more comfortable to the temperature. Just like drinking something hot in the summer makes you feel better. Although Ben & Jerry's also offers Hot Chocolate, Cider, and Coffee in the winter. And if its raining the scooper may be willing to give you some free hot fudge.

 * Ben & Jerry's has a lot of crazy cones that you can chose to eat your ice cream with, [[BR]] as you can see Yolo County legend ["AlishaIsrael"] modeling: [[BR]] attachment:alishawithcakes.jpg


And that ice cream sure can get scooped in a real wild fashion. [[BR]] Look at ["GavinJensen"] toss it up in the air and catch it. Don't try this at home folks: [[BR]] attachment:gavincatching.jpg

 * ["KatieWillheim"] makes the most delicious Caramel Brownie Sundae in California. We could not get picture of her because she believes cameras steal your soul.

 * ["FerGonzalez"]'s dedication to Ben & Jerry's is undeniable. Whether he's suffering from sleep deprivation or starvation, he will be at work...ready to scoop ice cream.

 * ["MaryKhlok"]'s scooping prowess is unmatched. Not only is she ambidexterous, but she is able to ignore physical pain and scoop even when gravely injured by a... cat scratch.

 * Canadian Sensation ["JoyChu"] has been imported for her impressive wafflecone making skills.  Be amazed by how she perfectly crafts each cone for your enjoyment. Mmmmm...

 * Oh yeah, and in addition to scoops, cookies, brownies, smoothies and milkshakes; Ben & Jerry's also makes cakes. [[BR]] Look at store manager and cake decorator ["RobRoy"] show off one of his designs: [[BR]] attachment:robwithcake.jpg
