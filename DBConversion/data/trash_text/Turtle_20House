The Turtle House gained its namesake from the large turtle displayed outside of their upstairs balcony.   Fall 2003, someone had stolen said turtle and the house hadn't been the same since.

From 1993-1996, the Turtle House was inhabited by members of the band Knapsack (some of whom went onto the Jealous Sound while Rob landed in Portland and played with The Hospitals).  Knapsack filmed a video in the basement of this house for the debut single from their first album on Alias Records in 1995.  The video was first played on MTV's "120 Minutes" and later was repeatedly aired as a "buzzworthy" video.

Past Shows:

 * ["Canseco"], The High Speed Scene and ["Legubitron"]

 * The ["Zim-Zims"]
