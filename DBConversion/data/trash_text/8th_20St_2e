8th Street runs East/West and consists of two streets East 8th and 8th. 8th changes names and address numbers at A Street.

Notable Locations along 8th Street from West to East include:

 * ["Castilian Hall" Castilian North] located where 8th turns the corner into Wake Forest Dr.
 * Church at the corner of 8th and B Street
 * Railroad Tracks
 * ["Valley Oak Elementary School"]

 * ["Videos To Go"]

While the speed limit is only 25mph for the length of 8th St, the traffic lights are timed quite well, making it an (often, quicker) alternate to ["Russell"] Blvd.  8th St also features a bike line for its entire length, and specific bicylist-operated traffic signals at the intersections with L St and B St.
