The Cross-Cultural Center is ocated on the corner of Shields and East Quad, across from Olson. The center plans campus events and programs which promote diversity and cross cultural education. They are open from 8am to 5pm Monday through Friday. 

The Cross-Cultural Center (CCC) serves as a community center for the students, faculty and staff at UC Davis. It provides a safe space for community members to explore themselves as well as learn about other races and cultures. We also have for public use an extensive library of reading materials by faculty and noted authors in the area of multiculturalism. EVERYONE is welcome at the CCC. Volunteer opportunities are also available.

As a tribute to the four original underrepresented communities for whom the Center was established, the ethnic theme of each community room remains while its function changes. We invite you to utilize the theme rooms.
