["Putah Creek"] is the primary drainage for the Davis area. ["Putah Creek"] no longer flows through campus, as the the creek was diverted to the south of Davis. The ["Waste Water Treatment Plant"] discharges its effluent into the south branch of ["Putah Creek"].

The segment of the Putah Creek which used to flow through the UC Davis ["Arboretum"], is now called the Arboretum Waterway, and it enhances the beauty of the setting, despite the concrete walls.  ["Lake Spafford"] is one of the many sites on this non-flowing section of waterway, near ["Mrak Hall"].  Every few years, this section of previously natural creek is drained for cleaning, and many stolen bicycles are recovered.

Many claim that "Putah" decends from a local Native American word.  However, more amusement is generated from the fact that ''puta'' in Spanish means "whore".
