There is an actual organization known as ["Davis Music Scene"].  They organize and flyer for associated bands, and also put on ["Davis Music Scene"] shows.  They aren't "all" of the Davis Music Scene, but it's convienent for them that their name is so inclusive.

In general, there's often shows on ["Campus"], in various cafés such as ["Cafe Roma"], and at a number of ["House Show" houses].  The houses have funny nicknames: ["Dam Haus"], The ["Bunny House"], ["Pirate Ship"], ["Turtle House"], ["Empty House"], and The ["Loyola House"]. ["Bill Wagman"] also hosts house concerts for traveling folk musicians on a regular basis.
