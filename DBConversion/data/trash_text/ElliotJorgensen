Elliot Jorgensen is a student at the University of California at Davis until June of 2005.  He has no idea what he wants to do with his following days, months or years.  Born in San Francisco, CA in the year 1982 and raised in Kentfield, CA from that point onward, Elliot went to San Domenico School, The Branson School, Austin College and Sacramento City College (in chronological order) before entering UC Davis in the fall of 2003.  He enjoys the natural world, meta-text, kindness and any music that is funky.  His favorite beer the world over (though he has yet to see the world over himself) is called Hoegaarden, a Belgium beer.  The only place to buy it in Davis is at the ["Davis Food Co-Op" co-op], a fine place to support in any manner.  What Elliot values most in life are his friends.  He currently spends his time reading for any kind of literature class, chillin with his housemates, going to the bars every now and then, exercising sporadically, engaging in only certain illicit activites and generally trying to have a good time, though never in that order.
