|| Ball Tag is a fun game to play with your friends late at night. ||
|| All you need are a few Nerf balls. Or any kind of balls for that matter, but nerf balls don't hurt so much when they hit you. ||

The rules are simple:
 * Define a playing area. Everyone stays in the playing area.
 * Hand out the balls to a few people. Make sure you have more people than you have balls.
 * If you have a ball, try to throw it at someone who doesn't have a ball. If you hit them, they have to take that ball as their own.
 * If you don't have a ball, try not to get hit by one.
 * Play for as long as you like.

Variations:
 * Have only one person without a ball. (Imagine the chaos!)
 * Allow people with balls to get hit. (So someone could have more than one ball at a time.)

The best place to play this game in Davis is at the ["Death Star"].
