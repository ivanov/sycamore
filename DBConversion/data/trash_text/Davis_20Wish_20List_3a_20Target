I could use a target right now.  People need their resonably priced tube socks, towels, toothpaste, deoderant, etc. - ["JaimeRaba"]

I don't want a big box store in Davis. It kills the whole idea of being a "small town". - ["RaynatoCastro"]
  * Well, ever since they put in Cost Plus, that whole idea is out the door.  And plus a Target out by 24-hour would be an area that would not be in the middle of town.  And also, Davis is not actually small.  It has too few stores to serve its population that exceeds 50,000. - ["JaimeRaba"]
    * While ["Cost Plus World Market" Cost Plus] is a chain, they pander to the inner-["Yuppies" yuppie] in us all. Target is where poor people shop, shesh. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]

What do you mean davis has too few stores to serve its population?  People have enough crap as it is. - ["MarieHuynh"]
  * People have to drive (burning fuel) to Woodland, Sacramento or Vacaville to obtain things that people need on a daily basis at a reasonable price.  It is in fact what people do, so why not spare the air and put in some establishments that will keep tax revenues in our cash-strapped county? - ["JaimeRaba"]
    * BAHAHAHAHAHAHA...  the truly cash strapped should stop wasting money on the car and BIKE more often.  Then they'll have more money to buy stuff they really need.  Anyone who can afford a car can afford the basic necessities.  Target has a lot of JUNK.  Those are not necessary to keep one alive.  We have stores that sell food and they usually have other basic things people need.  I have no car and do not go to Target but am still alive and well.  Let those that can afford extra junk go the little bit of extra distance.  Besides, Yolo county includes Woodland and West Sac  - ["MarieHuynh"]
    * No.  See, by cash strapped county, I mean Yolo county has difficulty providing social services because it has a big population and not a big tax base.  So they raise money primarily through taxing business.  I think Prop 13 also negatively impacts this, because it sort of takes property taxes out of the mix.  So, West Sacramento and Woodland's increasing amount of industrial complexes do provide somewhat of a tax basis, but then again they also have a lion's share of financial need.  And one thing that is absolutely clear is that Davis students ALREADY go outside the county for their major purchases.  So instead of spending money in Davis at the places openly criticized as being too expensive, they go elsewhere.  And these are places you cannot bike to.  Davis ALREADY has a big set of box stores that nobody really thinks of.  In addition to the Cost Plus that mars the dorm-centric area of Davis, Davis also has several "box" car dealerships and "box" gyms and "box" auto repair shops.  I think if one of these boxes (preferably in the mace/chiles area) held a store that would be more profitable to the inhabitants of Davis in terms of tax revenue and maybe actually giving them some value-priced merchandice, it would beneficial to all.  
    * When I think of major purchases, I think of computers, cars, and houses.  I'd rather not have people buy lots of crap here or anywhere else, period.  We don't NEED it.  I don't care if it's cheap.  And I really don't understand why students go and pay for memberships to gyms when they have a brand spanking new ARC.    - ["MarieHuynh"] 
    * People need food, soap, shampoo, toothpaste, clothing, etc.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's what I'm talking about.  And they waste tons of money buying it in Davis.  In fact, I think the reason why students eat out so much, is because the supermarkets' mark-ups are so high.  And if you need to buy a can opener?  What do you do?  You buy it at a 1000% markup at Safeway or Riteaid.  It's not good.  As far as gym membership, I think it's mostly people who don't have access to the ARC, or those who need 24-hour gym acess.  Hey, you didn't even know there ''was'' a 24-Hour Fitness!  - ["JaimeRaba" jr] 
    * you know all i got to say is that the Target Corp moving to davis is a horrible idea. there are 3 Targets within 18 miles of downotown Davis. They are probably going to close the Woodland one soon (Woodland Democract said that)... Have you thought about what that is going ot do to the people who depend on those jobs... are you now going to be happy cause you can buy your crappy free trade imported crap and cheap proces so someone making not even a living wage can drive form woodland, davis, west sac, dixon or somehwere else and seel it to you. their labor practices are horrible. they are building it next to a god damn EPA Superfund site. that's right, we can now buy some crappy crap right next to one of the most toxic clean up sites for a hundred mile radius. Big box stores suck, and if you went to the city coucli meetings, you woudl know that the tax revenue that we woudl get from the TArget does not add up becuase of increase in law inforcement, zoneing changes, etc... we would make between 40,-70,000 dollars as a city, which means nothing with the ammount of new traffic lights, cops, security, and cultural lameness that comes along with a Target. Poeple need jobs, but not ones that keep you down, selling crap, not having medical or dental (full time only and they limit the number of those), and NO living wage. Think about what you REALLY need, WHERE all the imported consumer crap (all that GMO and corporate food and plants too) comes from, and if this is comehting that will actually benefit us as a town or community in any way... by the way if you need a can opener, borrow  a neighbors or go to ace, or use a knife. dont be lazy, be creative...  - ["CompostNolan" blessings...] 
    * CompostNolan:  Again, people need shampoo and tubesocks outside the 1000% markup.  And I can understand that you're a big fan of people burning fuel to go to "close" places such as Woodland's "Mall" Target. There are very few employers in Davis who provide good benefits.  However, there are very many stores who sell cheap crap at huge markups.  At least Target's markups less ruthless.  I know there are many people who think a Target would be a losing proposition in terms of resources for the city.  That's why I think the Target would do better out by Mace and Chiles rather than the proposed site.  However, I also think the Proposed site would not cause a horrible amount of infrastructural nightmares for Davis, because, essentially, nothing is on 2nd street except "Box stores" containing gyms and other random things.  And frankly, I think it's a bit whimsical to think that Targets require increased police presence.  There are shoplifters everywhere.  Target isn't going to draw in out-of-Davisers, since the Vacaville, Sacramento, and Woodland locations are close enough for essentially all outlying areas.  The goods that people in Davis deserve are a long commute away.  What ''some'' people seem to fail to realize is that ''people already go to Target'', and that people have a constant need for things that are sold there, and that people are being ripped off in Davis.  OR, we could try and buy tubesocks at Ace.  Great idea.
       *  10 miles to Woodland is a long way for people on bicycles, and Yolobus requires careful planning to make a trip -- ["KenBloom"]
    * Just think!! Soon there will be a big box store in every town in America! What beauty! We can get all of our food, unneeded consumer goods, clothes, and anything else we even slightly desire under one big roof. Hear that… that is all the workers in free trade zones who made this stuff so happy that we are buying and buying… that cheer in the back ground, that’s the sound of Target shareholders jumping for joy while Mom and Pop shops close in Davis. Oh convenience… that is just what we need… that will make things so much easier for US!!! This community does not need this place… their stuff is cheaper because it is easier for big box stores to flood markets, get goods cheaper, while ignoring the people who made them, other local businesses, and the community they ‘serve’. Have it your way… we’ll stop by Starbucks to get some coffee and get McDonalds on the way home from Target k?? Your cheap sox are well worth all of the environmental degradation, cheap abused labor from all over SE Asia, Africa, and the Americas, and the sadness of decades old mom and pop shops closing in ever town in the US. How convenient! 
    * Okay, this really needs to be on its own page by now.  However, a few thoughts.  I agree that people are consumeristic to disgusting proportions.  But you can't BOTH say that "hey waste fuel and drive to woodland," but also don't build a target nearby because of how it causes 3rd world countries to underpay and otherwise exploit their employees.  Pick one.  The fact of the matter is that Davis is a town that sells a lot of trickets ("gifts!"), food and little else... there's really no DIRECT competition with Target.  Their buggest direct competition would be with big chains like Rite Aid and Longs (and Grocery stores to some extent)-- didn't you notice?  Davisites "import" just about everything.  Target is a much better choice than Walmart beacuse they tend to care a bit more about impact upon 3rd world countries--as well as greater selectivity in choosing its merchandise.  They're not perfect however.  But I think Target would be a good fit for Davis.  But it just needs to be put in the right spot. --["JaimeRaba"]
