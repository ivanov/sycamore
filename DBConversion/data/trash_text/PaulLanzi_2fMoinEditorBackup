Really two restaurants in-one: full-service on side, and a order-at-the-counter "eatery" on the other.  The full service restaurant is good if your looking for a somewhat classy place to take a date.  Its not as fancy as ["Soga's"] but still a good restaurant, but is also is not nearly as expensive.

They have an excellent grilled salmon BLT.  The atmosphere is very relaxing.  They've got good tea and quiche.  In fact, they provide some options for vegetarians: quiche, salads, portabello mushroom sandwich, spaghettini, grilled polenta triangles, quesadilla, cherry tomato pizzetta, and calzone. The quality of the food drastically varies depending on the chef.


The bar is on the full-service side, officially called Bar Bernardo.  The bar's hours are: Mon-Wed: until 11:00 pm; Thur-Sat: until 1:00 am; Sun: until 10:00 pm.  The WikiWackyWoo (no relation to the Wiki!) is particularly excellent.

[http://www.paragarys.com/cafebernardo/cafe_davis.asp Bernardo's] restaurant in Davis is actually one of three Bernardo's locations, the others being in ["Mid-town Sacramento"] and Roseville.  It is owned by the Paragary family, who also owns some of Sacramento's best bars and restaurants: ["Monkey Bar"], ["Paragary's Oven"], ["Blue Cue"], ["KBAR"], ["Centro"], and ["Esquire Grill"].
