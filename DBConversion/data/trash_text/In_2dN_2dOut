In-N-Out Burger, California's famous burger chain, serves some mighty fine hamburgers for reasonable prices. Because they are open somewhat late, it is a popular locale of students craving grease. In-N-Out (as well as ["Redrum Burger"]) also serves as a draw for people returining from Tahoe.

The menu is stupifyingly simple, but they have the capacity for a lot more than what's on the menu, such as burgers "animal style" (grilled onions) or a "4 by 4" (four patties, four slices of cheese), grilled cheese, protein style (no bun), etc.

The complete "secret" menu can be found through the ["In-N-Out Secret Menu"] entry.  Also see the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IN-N-OUT Wikipedia entry] for complete information on In-N-Out, including cult lore and everything else you'd like to know.
