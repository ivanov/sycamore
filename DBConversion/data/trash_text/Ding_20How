== Ding How: Davis's Best Chinese Dishes, a review by James Han ==

Ding How is one of those obscure ["Restaurants"] that aren't ever busy but should be based on the quality of their dishes. It's easy to see why many overlook this place: it's in an unglamorous location by ["Albertsons"], the decor is almost tacky, and the vibe is slow, simple, and low-key. However, like many outstanding dining spots, it's what you eat at Ding How that you'll remember, not trivialities like location.

Ding How serves a nice variety of Mandarin-style dishes in beef, pork, chicken, and seafood, and there is an impressive range of vegetarian dishes for a ["Chinese Food" Chinese restaurant]. Indeed, the quality and choice of the ["Vegetarian Options" vegetarian] dishes are such that I suspect that one of the cooks, if not the main cook, is a hardcore ["Vegetarian Options" vegetarian] Buddhist (Chinese Buddhist vegetarian cooking has a long history and is filled with amazing recipes). Also, unlike many other ["Chinese Food" Chinese places], Ding How for the most part is not heavy-handed with the cornstarch, oil, or monosodium glutamate. Your chicken, beef, pork, or tofu will be swimming in flavorful sauces, but it won't be the thick, gummy, oily, salty glop you get at most places, such as the godforsaken booths that seem to haunt every large mall's food court like moldering cadavers. The prices are reasonable, and the service is matter-of-fact, kind, and prompt.

The author (["JamesHan"]) makes the following suggestions:

  1. If you eat meat, a must-try is the "chin jiu" chicken. The smoky, rich, and mellow flavors infused into this chicken are just unbelievably good. It's not too salty, not too spicy, not too anything. It's "just right."

  2. Ding How is the place to try soup. Many ["Chinese Food" Chinese places] give their soups an overpoweringly salty/monosodium glutamate flavor and a gloppy, almost gel-like consistency. In contrast, almost any soup you get at Ding How will be "clear" in both flavor and texture, yet full-flavored and unbelievably rich and satisfying.

  3. Most of the few appetizers on Ding How's menu are ordinary and easily passed over without any regret. However, do try the shu mai if you eat meat, since Ding How's version is quite well done.

  4. ["Vegetarian Options" Vegetarians] have an ace in the hole with Ding How. There is a great variety of ["Vegetarian Options" vegetarian] dishes (yes, you get more than "mixed vegetables!" and "sweet and sour tofu!" at Ding How), and all are top-notch. A must-try is the ''vegetarian bowl soup'', which is my most favorite dish at this place. This soup is a wonderful melange of rich broth, mushrooms, tofu, taro root, clear noodles, cabbage, and a wide variety of fun, tasty Chinese-style "fake meats" that have traditionally been used in Buddhist vegetarian cooking. The soup is a meal in itself for two people.

  5. For an average of six bucks, you can get a fantastic lunch combination and eat till you are fit to burst. Try it!

''Are you kidding me?  3 friends and I ate there and the soup was VERY salty, the food was salty, the tea tasted funny and we did NOT take the leftovers home.'' - ["MarieHuynh"]


''I think the only good dish is their shrimp fried rice...'' -["JasminCamacho"]

''Note that vegetarians should ask for the vegetarian menu... on which most dishes are described as though they contain meat but in fact are prepared with meat substitutes.'' -- ["JeffNewmiller"]
