Wake Forest used to be arguably the worst apartment complex in Davis. Well, maybe not. But it was terrible. There are 3 different 2-bedroom plans available, each with either a balcony or a patio. There is a "study lounge" advertised in the brochure, but the closest thing there is to a study lounge is a dirty couch in the dimly-lit laundry room. The swimming pool is almost always clean, though, and the complex itself is extremely close to campus, the ["Oxford Circle Dining Commons"] (called "OCDC" for short), ["Starbucks"], and ["Rite Aid"]. Best of all is the low rent (about $950 a month). There is almost no parking out front, however, but don't dare to park in the parking lot out back-- you ''will'' get towed. 

Wake Forest Apartments, being right next to the ["University Mall" U-Mall], are the hot-spot in Davis for massive amounts of crows, especially during ["Crow Migration"].  This means a whole lot of crow shit everywhere.

''I've lived at Wake Forest for slightly over 2 years now. It used to be pretty much impossible to get anything repaired because of the constant landlord change. Every 3 or 4 months we had a new landlord, so there was no way to get anything fixed. There were loose nails in my carpet (a complaint shared by my neighbor as well), which took almost a year to fix. The toilet overflowed about 30% of the time (regardless of what you put in it, forcing us to designate several towels for the sole purpose of throwing on the ground in these frequent plumbing emergencies) for about 12 months, before any attempt was made to check out the problem. My oven caught on fire (literally engulfed in tall flames) for a full 13 months before I finally complained to the [http://www.city.davis.ca.us/ City of Davis] [http://www.city.davis.ca.us/pb/forms/code.cfm Code Compliance Line], and only then was it replaced. The garbage disposal hasn't worked in about 5 months but I'm too frustrated to do anything about it. The complex is under new ownership now though, and the new landlord is doing everything he can to boost its image.'' - ["SharonZimmerman" SharonZimmerman]    

''For clarification, we didn't continue using the oven after the initial oven-catching-on-fire situation; we're not that stupid. The old landlady simply sent the maintenance guy to clean it, even though the problem was clearly mechanical; it would reach what I would guess is around 600 degrees when set to 350.'' - ["AmyZimmerman" AmyZimmerman]

''And I should be able to give my 2 cents (cause I live with the Zimmermans).  Why we decided to live here another year I am really not sure, but thank god this year is our last.  Being close to campus is nice, except - I have not gone to UCD since we've lived here so I guess I dont care about that...but, being right on 113 is rad.  The complex is decorated with some nice ["Urban Art"] and we have some awesome neighbors.  Ok, but seriously - we have had a way bad experience and will never EVER live here again'' - ["ScottBiggart" ScottBiggart]
