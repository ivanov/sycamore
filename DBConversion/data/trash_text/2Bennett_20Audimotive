A clever play on "Automotive", 2Bennett Audimotive is a world-known and world-renowned Audi parts supplier, equipment manufacturer (though they primarily sell [http://www.goapr.com/Audi/ APR] equipment), Audi customizer and racing company.  Though their [http://www.2bennett.com/body_actionpics.html action photos] page consists mostly of Audis in various stages of crashing or post-crash, most of the work they do is on tuning Audis to make them faster and/or more nimble.  They will also perform more mundane car repair and maintenance services, but their labor rate is quite a bit higher than other shops for the same, basic, work.

2Bennett is often talked about on [http://www.audiworld.com/ AudiWorld], the leading site for discussion on tuning, maintaining and upgrading Audis.  Besides the ["Toad Tunnel"], this is probably one of Davis's most widely-known about features.
