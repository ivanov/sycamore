A lot can be said about the Students for an Orwellian Society.  It seems that they started off as a group of friends dedicated to having fun putting up flyers around campus, but their prominence and effect on ["Campus"] life has magnified in recent months -- due to more aggressive (and some say unfair) flyering and an effort to run for ["ASUCD"] ["Senate"].

= Name =
Students for an Orwellian Society should not be referred to as "the Orwellian Society", as the two names have different meanings. The latter means a society of Orwellians (whatever those are), and this usage is incorrect. The former name ("Students for an Orwellian Society") more correctly reflects their political goals.

= History of the Orwellians =
Students for an Orwellian Society is a nationwide student organization, founded at Columbia University in October of 2001 by Michael Castleman.  The UC Davis chapter was formed by ["RevChad" MiniTrue Chad Van Schoelandt] and ["BrentLaabs" MiniLuv Brent Laabs] in the spring of 2003.  Around this time, the United States, under the leadership of George W. Bush, began the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq invasion of Iraq] that some felt was unjust.  More importantly, some people felt that Bush's rhetoric about the war was essentially ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak newspeak]''.  This created a receptive atmosphere for the over-the-top flyers that Students for an Orwellian Society put out.  Many students found comfort and humor in the flyers that began popping up all over ["Campus"].

= Flyering efforts =
The flyers seem to be the primary outlet for the Orwellians to express themselves.  The Orwellian's flyers use of George Orwell's __1984__ as a satirical tool to evoke, provoke, and generally express a message to students.  The Orwellians are trying to paint things (such as national issues or ["Campus" campus] matters) as absurd by contrasting them with George Orwell's language.  In __1984__, George Orwell tells a story of a totalitarian society controlled by a universal, all-encompassing government which pacifies its people (mainly) by lies spun as truth.  The Orwellians mission seems to be to point out these same outrageous elements in our own society.

''The flyers, in early 2003, mainly focused on national issues such as gay marriage, the Iraq war, and Presidential candidates.  Some of the flyers also targeted ["Campus"] issues, such as the ["ASUCD"] installing a telescreen in the ["Memorial Union" MU] to show advertisements.''

As the Orwellians grew, so did the scope of issues taken on in their flyers.  ["ASUCD"] and other ["Campus"] matters are now regularly featured in Orwelllian flyers.  This is especially prevalent as a group (["ChadVanSchoelandt" Chad Van Schoelandt], ["MarieHuynh" Marie Huynh], and ["ChrisRood" Chris Rood]) of their members are pursuing seats on the ["ASUCD"] ["Senate"] under the new slate, ["SOSSS"].

''The funny part is that they're actually probably the best people for the job.'' - ["PhilipNeustrom"]


= Controversy =
Some say that the Orwellians are unfair in their flyering practices, placing flyers over bulletin boards such that they cover the entire board leaving no other flyers visible.  While the Orwellians occasionally do cover entire boards with their flyers, they are not in violation of ["SPAC"] posting rules regarding bulletin board postings.  The official ["SPAC"] policy (taken from their [http://spac.ucdavis.edu/policies.htm policy page]) is that:

[[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]]''1. Only one notice per event/activity per bulletin board is allowed.''

The Orwellians have never posted the same flyer more than once on the same board -- instead they fill the board with a bunch of ''different'' flyers.

While the Orwellians may have not broken rule #1, they might be breaking rule #5, ''"Organizations or persons posting or exhibiting materials in a language other than English must file a translated copy of the materials with Student Programs and Activities Center."''  Clearly, their flyers are not in English, but are instead in ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak newspeak]''.

= Misunderstanding =
There have been a few ["The California Aggie" California Aggie] articles regarding the Orwellians.  The first was [http://www.californiaaggie.com/article/?id=3204 this article], which focused on what Sheri Atkins, director of the UCD ["LGBTRC" Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Resource Center], called a "hostile climate for students" that was created by the flyers (referring to the flyers regarding gay marriage).  The Orwellian flyers regarding these issues are clearly satirical.  However, when asked about their flyers and their organization, the Orwellians respond in newspeak.  The Orwellians believe that the way to respond to (serious) questions about their intentions is to respond in newspeak-esque language.  Asking what the intentions or beliefs of the Orwellians are is ridiculous in the first place -- they make it quite clear what they think in all of their flyers.  Only humorless individuals fail to understand what the Orwellians believe.
