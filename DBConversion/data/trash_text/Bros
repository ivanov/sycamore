Bros is plural form of Bro and can refer to a group of Bros or just the idea of Bros in general. The Bro can be best characterized as the wanabe jock/ wanabe fratboy, although many fratboys and jocks can fall into the Bro catagory. Bro, which can also be pronounced "Brah" or "Braw" is often used as a term of endearment amongst other Bros. A good place to go bro watching is the ["ARC"]. The ["Davis Players Society"] is a non-["Fraternity"] social group who's members might be Bros.

*Sidenote:
''A brah myself, I disapprove of the indiscriminate use of the term. Brahs are not necessarily associated with frats or idiocy, but can refer to those who resist selling out by keeping it real and having a good time regardless of social status or popularity. 40's are encouraged though. - ["ErnBro"]'' 

The Bro Lexicon:

 * Sup bro?
