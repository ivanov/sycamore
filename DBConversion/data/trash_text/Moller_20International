= Questionable Business =

Over the years there has been an increasing number of people who wonder if Moller is a real business or a scam.  He has been two years from releasing a commercial model for the past twenty years.  Enough people have invested in his concept and become disillusioned to hold informal "Burned by Moller" conventions.  The only flights his "400 miles an hour on normal gas" vehicles have ever taken are short hops, almost always tethered to the ground, and always for groups of shareholders or potential investors.  The military has looked into Moller's crafts and declined to invest or purchase... but have done so to several other "personal flying craft" companies.

In recent years he has taken to touting Organtic Almond Butter as a way to live longer, pitching it in a pseudo-scientific slick salesman manner.  He often mentions it in public appearances about the Skycar, and sends jars to reporters.

Other than shares in his company, the only thing for sale from Moller are kitch like models, licence plate frames and glossy photos of his prototype M400.  You can, however, deposit $100,000 toward a $995,000 Skycar with an uncertain release date.
