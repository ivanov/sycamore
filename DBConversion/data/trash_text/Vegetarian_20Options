Davis' reputation as a vegetarian, liberal, Birkenstock-wearing kind of town is not really too far off base.  However, to the surprise of many vegetarians, vegans and other herbivores, the Davis restaurant scene does little to cater to vegetarians.  (This is probably because most of the local vegetarians prepare their own food.)

Be sure to provide your own insights, and be sure to say why you feel the way you do.  Feel free to sign your contribution, as others have. 

= Food Strategies =
 * Tofu is usually a "meat" option at most ["Chinese food" Chinese restaurants] and Thai restaurants.  
 * Eggplant and portobello mushrooms are becoming popular sandwich items at ["Trendy Restaurants"].

''This was recently changed from "Eggplant and portobello mushroom is a" to "Eggplant and portobello mushrooms are becoming".  The difference is simple: Are the sandwiches that are becoming popular made of eggplant and portobello or are there eggplant sandwiches and portobello sandwiches, both of which are becoming popular?'' -- ["JabberWokky" jw]

= Vegetarian Reviews =
== Americana ==
 * Both the ''House Special'' and the ''Cheese Pesto Sandwich'' are amazing at ["Delta of Venus"]
   * ["Delta of Venus"] is very friendly - vegetarian options outweigh the few seafood options that they serve.  Everything there is really good. Make sure to say "hi" to ["SharonZimmerman"] if she's working :)
 * ["Pluto's"] Salads / Spuds  (even their small salad is big enough for a meal).

== Chinese ==
 * ["Ding How"] allows most any dish to be ordered in a vegetarian option, and most people say they taste great too.
 * ["Old Teahouse"] has a good tofu something (it is on the back side of the menu).  Their fried soy sauce noodles (that's not the name on the menu, but it is close to that) are really, really good too.
 * ["Orange Hut"] has a pretty good eggplant and tofu dish.
 * ["Wok n' Roll"] has a tofu and vegetable plate with rice that is fairly cheap and decently good; mind you, it's not fantastic but it's definitely good for the price.

== Crepes / French ==
 * ["Crepeville"] - from make-your-own crepes (mushrooms, spinach, tomato), to dessert crepes. Try a side of potatoes or ''smoked tofu'' (SO GOOD!)
 * They also have a great sandwich option (I forgot it's name!) with cheese and eggplant

== Indian ==
 * ["Kathmandu Kitchen"] might be the best vegetarian food in Davis, take that advice or leave it.  It's completely vegetarian-friendly and if you go to the buffet you will never leave unsatisfied.

== Korean ==
 * ["Manna Korean"] has a couple of vegetarian options; not a lot of them on the menu though.
   * Make sure you ask if the curry has fish sauce in it.  Fish sauce is usually included in most curries unless you ask for it not to be (most every dish can accommodate this)
   * At any restaurant, it's best to just ask about what ingredients are used.  I don't know about ["2k Thai Food"], however ["Sophia's Thai Kitchen" Sophia's] has always been very friendly about preparing dishes without fish sauce.  Also, if you want something that is fried, make sure the oil isn't used to cook their meat products! - ["KimKunaniec"]

== Mediterranean ==
 * ["Ali Baba"] has a really good "Vegetarian Special," you can either order a whole order or half.  Rumor has it that a half order is the same amount of vegetable but less rice and a little cheaper.  You can also get a portobello mushroom hamburger there.
 * ["Pita Pit"] has a rather extensive selection, and employees are conscious of various vegetarian concerns and take great pains to prepare vegetarian food on special surfaces that do not at all come into contact with meat.
  * They aren't necessarily always that vegetarian-conscious, it really depends on who you get and how much they care. It is important that you ask that they microwave anything that would normally be cooked on the non-vegetarian-friendly grill - ["KristenBirdsall"]
 * ["Sam's Mediterranean"] has a really good falafel that is definitely worth checking out over ["Pita Pit"]

== Mexican / Mexican Influenced ==
 * ["Chipotle"] is decently vegetarian-friendly but they just don't have as many options as the other Mexican restaurants in Davis in general.  However, you can get a bowl of rice, black beans and cheese for under $2.00 and add the free soda if you have a reg card and you have one cheap meal (a cautionary piece of advice: there is one lady there who charges more. Technically you're getting 3 sides but she charges for a quesadilla and something else.  Maybe that's what they're supposed to do?)
     * Their current website says "our cheese is made from a vegetable-based rennet and is therefore vegetarian." However, the last time I visted their website (about a year ago), their website said, "Our cheese is made from an animal-based rennet and is therefore not vegetarian." I find this interesting, and wonder if Chipotle simply changed the type of cheese that they use, or just screwed up their food labeling on their website either then or now. Anyone have any knowledge about this?
     * I believe they actually changed the kind of cheese they used.  At about that same time they started emphasizing their vegetarian product line more, and overhauled their menu.
 * ["Taqueria Guadalajara"] makes one fine vegetarian burrito along with many other options, there's also the vegetarian nachos.  In any case ["Taqueria Guadalajara" Guad] is very vegetarian-friendly.
  * ["Taqueria Guadalajara"] makes their refried beans with LARD--and they never tell you this when you order a "Vegetarian Burrito." Make sure to request black beans when you go there.
  * One time, I ordered a plain quesadilla - tortilla with cheese in the middle. When I picked it up to eat it, there were chunks of meat stuck to the bottom of it. Needless to say, I was thoroughly annoyed. However, I've since learned to appreciate their vegetarian burritos simply because I live so close to the place. But I'll echo what someone else said, make sure you order it with black beans. I'd also recommend no extra pico. - ["TerraSmithers"]
 * ["Taqueria Super Tamale"] does not use any lard or meat broth in their refried beans or rice.
  * It's one of my favorite restaurants in Davis, but many people have never heard of it. -["RishiTrivedi"]

== Sandwiches ==
 * ["Nugget"] has an extensive selection of toppings for yummy fresh veggie sandwiches. (Recommended: ''The Veggie'' on a croissant with havarti cheese). They also have an awesome veggie soup on certain days, and tons of pasta salads and other goodies from their deli section.
   * Their vegetarian panini is really good.
   * both the ["The Co-Op"] and ["Nugget"] are really good for vegetarian and vegan shopping.  They have stuff that ["Safeway"] couldn't even try to fit into their newly added "natural food" section.

== Thai ==
 * ["2k Thai Food"] has the best Thai food in town.  Try the panang (peanut curry) with tofu.
  * Here, and at all the other Thai restaurants in Davis, you order just about anything on their menu with tofu in place of meat.
  * This restaurant gives generous portions and is reasonably priced, but it isn't the best Thai restaurant in town.  They're pretty much on par with each other overall.
 * ["Thai Recipes"] by ["Tapioca Express"] has a lot of good tofu dishes, though unfortunately it's kind of expensive. I believe it was voted one of the most vegetarian-friendly restaurants in Davis a few years back.

== Vegetarian Food at Meat-Oriented Restaurants==
 * ["In-N-Out"] Grilled Cheese or Animal Style Grilled Cheese.  Also, animal style fries is practically a whole meal.  It's not on the menu so ask for it by name.
 * ["Redrum Burger"] - Veggie burger, and potato and veggie side dishes.  They also have a mushroom burger
   * Does Redrum have a cooking surface for solely vegetarian food?  Otherwise one runs the risk of getting their vegetarian goods effectively sauteed in animal fat.
    - as for this, I'm not sure but being rather familiar with some people that work there...my guess is that they're not super vegetarian conscious. - ["KristenBirdsall"]
 * ["Wendy's"] you can get a $.99 baked potato with sour cream and chives, they also have a potato with cheese and broccoli that is a little more expensive.
 
''It might be worth noting that even if there appears to be nothing on the menu that is vegetarian at any given restaurant, they are usually not unwilling to make something specially for you.''

==  Vegan-Conscious reviews ==

 * ["Delta of Venus"] has a number of vegan options.
 * ["Hing's"] is reputed to have roughly 12 vegan options in their buffet.
 * ["Sam's Mediterranean" Sam's] and ["Ali Baba"] offer vegan entrees including falafel, dolma, and hummus with pita.
 * ["Vegetarian Restaurant"] In nearby ["Woodland"], there is a vegan vietnamese restaurant.
   * I've heard this is really good. -["KristenBirdsall"]
   * It is quite good -- amazing what one can do with tofu...-["JenniferPetrik"]

== Student Farm Veggie Baskets ==

 * I've had a subscription to the Student Farm Veggie Baskets for the last six months or so. They are great! You get lots of fresh organic veggies for a great price. It's a good option for those who want to eat healthy but can't afford the supermarket organic prices. The basket is more (quite more) than enough for two people. You can go to the [http://studentfarm.ucdavis.edu/ Student Farm] webpage for more information.- ["AnaluciaCordova" Ana Lucia]
