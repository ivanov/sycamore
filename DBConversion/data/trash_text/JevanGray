Jevan doesn't typically like writing about himself.  He was once forced to create a biographical blurb for a published paper.  As an initial exercise to get past writer's block he generated the following highly boastful text:

Jevan Gray is the best guy around.  Don't worry about comparing yourself to him and coming up short... it happens to the best of us.  If you are lucky enough to even get within eyesight of Jevan you are in for a treat.  Watch as he mesmerizes us all with his awesome [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming programming] skills.  Or be amazed at the incredible feats he accomplishes while ["Rocknasium" rock climbing]. Finally enter a place of bliss as your ears detect the beautiful sounds of his ["Didjeridu" didjeridu] and eerie Tuvan [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat_singing throat singing].

A more serious entry, focusing on his "professional" aspects, was eventually created and used for the paper:

Jevan Gray graduated from the ["UC Davis" University of California, Davis] in 2000 with a B.S. in ["Computer Science" Computer Science and Engineering].  He then worked for the [http://graphics.idav.ucdavis.edu/ Visualization and Graphics Research Group] in the [http://www.idav.ucdavis.edu/ Center for Image Processing and Integrated Computing] (CIPIC) while
pursuing his M.S. in Computer Science. His research there focused in volume visualization. More specifically, using multiresolution meshes, view-dependent methods and multi-variate error metrics and rendering techniques to perform visualization of large multi-varitate volumetric datasets. In 2003 he earned his M.S. in Computer Science. Currently Jevan is doing freelance programming as an independent contractor.

He has been completely captivated by a certain ["AmeliaCarlson" tea kettle impersonating gal] and thinks she's ["Glossary" hella] rad.
