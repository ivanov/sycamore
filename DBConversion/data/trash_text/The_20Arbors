Located at 1280 Olive Drive, [http://www.thearbors.com The Arbors] is just down the street from ["In-N-Out"], ["PC Game Arena"], ["The Olive Drive Market"] and just down and across the tracks from the ["Train Station"].  Also within walking/crawling distance to ["Sudwerk"] (hint - cross the train tracks right where 2nd turns, and it is a nice mellow walk there, a fun crawl back).

Although the ["Olive Drive" area] is referred to as a ghetto, The Arbors stands apart with a tranquil quality (and security gate).

If you plan on moving here, you have 3 choices for high speed internet: SBC DSL, Comcast Cable Modem, and InstaConnect Wireless.  Or you can just use one of the (many) open connections.  For information, call (530) 756-2424.

Wiki users that live here (as of 12/2004) include Evan ["JabberWokky"] E., ["TarZxf"] and ["SarahHillard"].
