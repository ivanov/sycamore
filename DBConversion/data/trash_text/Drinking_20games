Drinking games are games that involve the act of drinking.  Some, such as the universal drinking game, are simple.  Others are complicated and pressing.  While drinking games can be fun, they can also be dangerous -- excessive, binge drinking is '''never''' a good idea.  Be safe and responsible in your drinking.

Some drinking games are:
  * ["Anchor Man"]
  * ["Beer Pong"]
  * ["Century Club"]
  * ["Chandeliers"]
  * ["Drinking Scrabble"]
  * ["Drunk Driver"]
  * ["Edward 40 Hands"]
  * ["Fuck the Dealer"]
  * ["Harmon Killebrew"]
  * ["High-Low"]
  * ["King's Cup"]
  * ["Nine-Nine-Bust-A-Rhyme"]
  * ["Moose"]
  * ["Power Hour"]
  * ["Quarters"]
  * ["Rossi Challenge"]
  * ["Sloshball"]
  * ["Survivor Flip-Cup"]
  * ["The Nicholas Cage Drinking Game"]
  * The universal drinking game:
    Drink, while playing game.

See also ["Strip games"] for the obvious (strip games can also be drinking games, of course).
