    If you recently moved to Davis and/or are attending school here, it is important to remember that all weather is relative.  Somebody from Boston will love the incredibly mild and comfortable winters.  Somebody from Miami will find the dry summers mild and comfortable.  Someone from ["SoCal" Southern California] will be miserable year-round.  Everybody has different comfort levels.

= Seasons =
== Summer ==
["Davis"] summers are scorching hot.  High temperatures are regularly in the 90s (that's 30s for those of you who are metric).  On particularly hot days the temperature reaches into the 100s.  Sometimes, we get ["Thunderstorms"], but they are much rarer than they are east of the Rockies.
== Fall ==
Fall is a lot like summer, only slightly cooler.  It's hard to point to a particular season which seems like Autumn in Davis.
== Winter ==
["Davis"] winters are bone-chilling and seem to last around six months.  There is often a lot of ["Fog"] which warms things up a little. If the fog warms things up then why is it 70 in placerville and a freaking 40 degrees here-["BryanBell"]  If the trees haven't already lost their leaves in our one-week-long Fall season, they lose them now.  Winter is basically the period that it rains, but we also get a lot of fog.
== Spring ==
Spring is the nicest time of year, with only occasional rain and a lot of ["Delta Breeze"] to keep it from getting too hot.  The plants are very green, and ["The Quad"] is somewhat less muddy.
