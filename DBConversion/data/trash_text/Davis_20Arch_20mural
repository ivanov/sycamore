There used to be a mural depicting the Davis Arch (also long gone) that was painted in 1976 on the north side of the Hotel Aggie/Terminal Hotel. The hotel was on the northeast corner of 2nd and G, and the mural could be seen from the ["ACE Hardware" Davis Lumber] parking lot.

For more information on the hotel and the mural, see John Lofland's ''Demolishing a Historic Hotel: A Sociology of Preservation Failures in Davis, California''.
