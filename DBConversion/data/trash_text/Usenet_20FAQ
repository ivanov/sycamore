The term "FAQ" or "Frequently Asked Questions" predates the World Wide Web.  Long before the web existed, the internet had other ways of being used.  One of the more popular was usenet, a message system that technically predated internet itself, and still exists today.  Popular at universities, most universities have a usenet server and university specific newsgroups.  UC Davis is no exception, and the ucd.* series of groups have their own FAQ list.  news.ucdavis.edu is UC Davis' usenet server.   However, these days USENET groups are mostly used to disseminate pornography, although there is an historical archive of USENET at [http://groups-beta.google.com/], and you can use it to see the huge extent to which the UC Davis groups were used.

Last updated in 1996, the FAQ can be [http://faqs.netesq.com/ucdavis/part1.html found here].

In it you can find thrilling questions such as ''"Why should I use the Internet?''"

''2004-12-21 21:06:43'' [[nbsp]] Yeah, the guy who wrote this FAQ went to UCD Law school and is an interesting guy.  He makes his living selling technology solutions to law firms.  I asked him about updating it once, and he said that I should by all means.  This site has filled the void left by the out-of-date FAQ, however.  However, it would be interesting to have a pseudo-FAQ where people post questions and it's answered by referring people to certain links on this site. - ["JaimeRaba"]------

''2005-01-26 11:04:57'' [[nbsp]] USENET first was disseminated among dialup servers and bulletin board systems (BBSs) in the 1979-80ish era, and the NNTP protocol came about in around 1985 which brought newsgroups to TCP/IP networks. --["JaimeRaba"]------
''2005-01-26 11:24:52'' [[nbsp]] Not quite BBSes, nor quite "dialup servers".  It was an answer to mailing lists inhouse at Duke.  For awhile, some segments of the network were connected by tape backups of the spools that were physically mailed between countries.  UUCP was (and still is) a valid and effective form of connecting two peers.

''2005-01-26 17:46:43'' [[nbsp]] Well, not at first.  But my BBS started using a "doorway" relay service for the groups we subscribed to around 1982.   --["JaimeRaba"]
