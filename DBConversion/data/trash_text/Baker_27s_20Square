Baker's Square is a good place to grab a decent meal at a decent price.  They are better than decent in the areas of pies and ["Breakfast" breakfast], and you can generally expect good service.  Dinners can be pricier, but portions are suitably larger.  Their coffee is better than one would expect and features free refills.  While this place is not studier-friendly, one does occassionally see people pulling it off.  

A good deal is the "Rise and Shine" breakfast which costs in the viscinity of $4.  You can also substitute the hashbrowns/country potatoes for rice pilaf, veggies, and sometimes--a small salad.  Actually, one very nice thing about this restaraunt is that they're more than happy to substitute just about anything.

They also serve breakfast all day long, for those who like breakfast for dinner.
