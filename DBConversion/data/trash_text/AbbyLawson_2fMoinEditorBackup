S.O.S. stands for Ski or Snowboard (Club), the largest social ["Student Organizations" club] at ["UC Davis" UCD], one that is devoted to ["Snow Sports" snow sports].

The purpose behind S.O.S. is to get skiers and snowboarders up to the snow for as ["Living Cheaply" cheap] as possible and provide a good time. The club has ranged anywhere from 200-800 members in past years, though currently it hosts about 450 members along with 15 staff and officers. S.O.S. is known for their wild parties and unique ["Drinking games" drinking games].

Membership for the '04-'05 school year is $30 for new members, and $25 for returning. This fee scores you a free t-shirt (that glows in the dark) as well as an SOS Card that will earn you tons of great discounts around town (["Ben & Jerry's"], ["Jamba Juice"], ["Woodstock's Pizza" Woodstock's], ["Ken's Bike & Ski"], ["Rocknasium"], ["Ground Zero"], etc.), as well as a chance to save on lift tickets. Speaking of our sponsors, we also have "Members Only" sale nights at both ["Ken's Bike & Ski"] as well as ["Ground Zero"], in which only members gain access to the store with items up to 80% off! Membership also gives you access to our cabin, 5 miles outside of Tahoe City, complete with a hot tub and a cleaning lady. Members can stay there any time for only $10/night as long as you let us know in advance. The major perk with being an SOS member is that you get to save big bucks on lift tickets, sometimes up to $25 off! We also offer deals for Double Whammy season passes, but if you buy them through us, then you are automatically entered into a drawing (one in ten win) for a Vertical Plus upgrade... which basically means you get to stand in the shorter lift lines, and earn free food and souviniers the more you ride. Plus, another benefit is that if you have a yearning to go to the snow, but no ride, we can organize one for you for any of our trips! And finally, being an SOS member gives you full access to any of our parties that always guarantee a good time.

'''REMEMBER!!''' We table in ["The Quad" the quad] Monday through Thursday (weather permitting) from 10AM-2PM. Stop by, sign up for a trip, steal some stickers, or strike up a conversation with a friendly SOS officer or staff member. We're always friendly and can answer any questions you may have, and may ''even'' be able to set you up on a date with somebody. We can do it all!

= Upcoming Events =

 * 02/13/05: Day Trip to [http://www.kirkwood.com Kirkwood]
                    Due to Kirkwood being a long drive away, we don't offer many trips to this area, so be sure not to miss out on this day trip! So be sure to sign up at tables in the quad or online, and we can organize a ride for you. As usual, we meet in the ["ARC"] parking lot at 7 AM and then head up to the snow together. Directions will be given out. And, for those looking for some post skiing or snowboarding fun, Jackson Rancheria is right nearby, one of the few Indian Casinos open to those 18 and over! 
 * 02/18-21/05: NOR-CAL (aka: the biggest cabin trip of the year!)
                       If you are to pick only one cabin trip to go on this year, Nor-Cal is for you! This is the largest and craziest cabin trip we offer. We'll be offering two cabins, ours and another one, and three days of sick riding that includes 2 days at [http://www.squaw.com Squaw], and one at [http://www.northstarattahoe.com Northstar]. We will also be competing against other UC's for the coveted "Nor-Cal Cup." In order to win the cup though there are several events such as: Race the Mountain, Snow Volleyball, Dirty Dancing, Thumper, and more. This trip is not one to be missed.
 * 02/27/05: Day Trip to [http://www.sugarbowl.com Sugarbowl]
                     If you are done with your homework for the weekend or just want to get the hell out of Davis for the day, then day trips are the ideal trip for you. We'll be heading up to Sugarbowl, so if you are interested sign up and we can organize a ride for you. We meet in the ["ARC"] parking lot at 7 AM and then ride up to the snow and pass out lift tickets for the day. This is a great option for those who don't have the time for a cabin trip, but still yearn to head up to the mountains for a day.
 * 03/04-06/05: Final Cabin Trip!
                  So by this time, if you haven't managed to drag your butt up on one of our righteous cabin trips: shame on you. However, you have one more chance. This weekend we'll be heading to [http://www.squaw.com Squaw] and [http://www.northstarattahoe.com Northstar] for some fun. This trip is sure to be big for it is our last of the school year. As always, the trip will be held at the SOS Cabin.
 * Spring Quarter: Staff Elections!
                 So you went on a cabin trip and now you're hooked, eh?  In addition to the five officer positions, we also have about 10-15 staff positions as well. Staff is required to attend meetings once a week, table 4hr/week, chalk twice a week, and help run trips and meetings when called for. Though it may sound like a lot of work the perks are good and the people tend to be easy-going. It's a ton of fun and an awesome way to make friends. Come to staff elections and show us what you got. No experience necessary.
 * Spring Quarter: Float Trip
                Ever been on a river raft? Ever done a keg stand in a river raft while going down the American River? Just ask anybody who went on the trip last year and the answer is probably 'yes'! Join us for a weekend floating down the American River and camping out with UC Santa Cruz! Expect tons of fun, though it can tend to get a little crazy...
 * Spring Quarter: Houseboats
               Similar to the Greek's version of ["houseboats"] except instead of other Greek organizations, you'll find other Ski or Snowboard clubs from all of the UC's, each with their own boat! Wild times will ensue.
