From the web site: Natural Food Works, founded in 1972, makes the connection between food and wellness. The Farmer's Kitchen Cafe offers delicious, homemade bioregional foods, free of gluten and casein. Your food is made with locally grown and organic fruits and vegetables, free range meats and wild fish. No aluminum pans, no hydrogenated fats, no microwaved foods, no unnatural additives.

Everything is seasonal & local and that means FRESH.  The menu changes daily, so check the website or call before you go - although you'll always find something good.  Very vegetarian and vegan friendly, but also offer meat choices.  There's free wireless internet, a huge selection of teas, outside dining when the weather is nice and a friendly staff.  Check out the website for information on delivery, catering and fresh, gluten-free breads, bagels and pies made daily.  There are also plenty of glutenous foods, but they cater to people with food sensitivities/allergies.
