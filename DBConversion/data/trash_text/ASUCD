The Associated Students of the University of Calfornia, Davis (ASUCD) is a term describing the undergraduates at UCD. Just by being an undergrad you're automatically a member of ASUCD, you don't even need to sign a form or anything. More often, the phrase "ASUCD" is used to describe the governing body of ASUCD.

Similar to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_government the US government], ASUCD has an Executive, a Legislative, and a Judicial branch. The association's '''$9.2 million dollar operational budget''' funds a host of student services such as ["Unitrans"], the ["Coffee House"], Campus Copies and Classical Notes, the ["Bike Barn"], and the ["Experimental College"]. A fundamental characteristic of ASUCD is that it is primarily student managed and staffed, employing an upwards of 1,500 students. ASUCD offers golden oppurtunties to engage in leadership activities that range from student advocacy to management and finance and to event planning. Meetings are open to the public, and held every Thursday during the school year, in the Mee Room (3rd floor ["Memorial Union"]) starting at 5:30pm.

ASUCD has an [http://asucd.ucdavis.edu official website] with more information than anyone ever bothers to read, including the ASUCD Constitution, from which much of the following information is robbed.

== Executive ==
 * The ["ASUCD President"] and ["ASUCD Vice President" Vice President] are elected during the 7th Week of Winter Quarter each year using ["Instant Runoff Voting"].  The term is one year. To be eligible for the ASUCD Presidency, one must have completed 60 units (not necessarily at Davis) and have been a registered UC Davis student for at least two quarters prior to election.
 * The ["ASUCD President"] does not have the ability to introduce legislation, but is responsible for the yearly budget and appointing the directors of all ASUCD units except for the ["The California Aggie"] and ["KDVS"] which are appointed by the ["Campus Media Board"].
 * Current sitting President (04-05) is ["Kalen Gallagher"]. He sits at the computer and when you visit his office, he'll be sure to add you to his [http://www.thefacebook.com facebook] friendslist.

 * The ["ASUCD Vice President"] serves as presiding officer over all ["Senate" senate] meetings, as well as being the legal successor to the ["ASUCD President"], if he/she is wounded in battle or otherwise removed from his/her position.
 * Current sitting Vice President is Paloma Perez, former ["GASC"] commissioner and chief of staff. She runs quite the senate meeting. 
 * Current sitting Controller is Cameron Menezes. He controls things.
   * The President is in charge of appointing an ASUCD Controller, who must be confirmed by 2/3rds of the ["Senate"]. According to ASUCD's site, the official duties of the controller are: "work[ing] on all phases of management planning, budgeting, implementation, and evaluating. In addition, they monitor the expenses of all AS activities."
 * Advocacy Units are directly under the executive, and include among others Pathfinder and the Student Advocacy Office.

== Legislative ==
 * There are 12 seats on the ASUCD ["Senate"].  They are elected six at a time during the 7th Week of Fall Quarter and the 7th Week of Winter Quarter using ["Choice Voting"].
 * Commissions play an integral role in the ASUCD senate. There are seven of them, vaguely described in the Constitution as follows:
  1. ["Academic Affairs Commission"] - Recommends to ASUCD programs and policies in Academic Affairs areas. Disseminates information concerning the student development of courses and curriculum. They honor teachers that go above and beyond each year.
  2. ["Internal Affairs Commission"] - Investigates and recommends improvements in areas and services which affect the quality of student life. Orchestrates administrative plans for all ASUCD units and reviews legislation for anything internal, ie delegating campus affairs.
  3. ["Business and Finance Commission"] - Formally advises ["Senate"] on fiscal concerns and financial allocations.
  4. ["External Affairs Commission"] - Acts as liason with off-campus bodies which affect students. Works with Executive office and Senate to reccomend action for city, county and national affairs.
  5. ["Ethnic and Cultural Affairs Commission"] - Programmatic commision that holds Diversity Days every Fall. Acts as Liason with off-campus bodies affecting ethnic groups. Investigates and reccomends policies regarding ethnic community issues.
  6. ["Environmental Policy and Planning Commission"] - Researches environmental issues and reccomends improvements regarding them. Performs environmental audits of ASUCD units.
  7. ["Gender and Sexuality Commission"] - Programmatic commission that promotes awareness of issues regarding gender, sexuality, sex and sexual assault through educational workshops, panels and keynote speakers. Plans Generation Sex Week and the Western Regional LGBT Conference with the ["LGBTRC"].
 * Commission chairs act as non-voting members of the senate, though all legislation not marked as "urgent" must be analyzed by a comission before being put up for vote.
 * Committees, similar to commissions in the sense that they are composed of volunteers..the only difference is that they make informal recommendations to Senate, as opposed to the official recommendation of the commissions. The committees are: Health and Wellbeing committee and ["Elections Committee"].

== Judicial ==
 * The ["ASUCD Court"] is in charge of interpreting the ASUCD Constitution and other fun legal-type documents.  There is currently a discrepency in the bylaws leading to "legal confusion" as to whether the proper name of the entity is "ASUCD Court" or "Student Court."
 * There are nine members on the ASUCD Court, each of which is appointed by the ASUCD President and approved by a majority of the ["Senate"] when a vacancy arises. Court members serve terms as long as their membership in ASUCD (remember that this means "as long as they're an undergraduate"), up to a maximum of four years.
 * Current sitting Court Chief Justice is ["KrisFricke" Kris Fricke], who must be some kind of legal robot, as he knows far more about Student Government than any reasonable human being.

== Bureaucracy - Student Services and Student Government Advising Office ==
 * Business Manager is ["Mark Champagne"].  He is the top of the University (unionized) employee heirarchy within ASUCD.  The "Student Services" office is his personal playground
 * Student Services is best known as the source of paychecks for ["Coffee House"] and other ASUCD employees.  They do all the human resources and other office work for the "commercial units"
 * ASUCD Advisor is ["Eric Sanchez"] (formerly ["Vicki Swett"])
 * ["SGAO" Student Gov't Administrative Office] (SGAO, though invariably pronounced as "SJAO") is the civil service of the ASUCD government - they perform government bureacratic necessities for entities Vicki Swett likes (inversely, they officially refuse to do work for the ["ASUCD Court"])
  * Government Documents are available at the Student Government Administrative Office (["SGAO"]), or (in a probably outdated and incomplete form) [http://asucd.ucdavis.edu/gov/docs/ online]
