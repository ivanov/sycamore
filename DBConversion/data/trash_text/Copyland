A small copy business on G Street next to ["Next G Wireless"].  They have about four copy machines for public use but it looks as though they aim to serve businesses more than walk-in customers.  They also carry a short list of about 15 course readers, which are generally less expensive than those from ["Navin's Copy Shop" Navin's] but of poorer quality.
