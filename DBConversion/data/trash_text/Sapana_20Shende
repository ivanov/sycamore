= Background =
Sapana Shende was born July 26th, 1983. She grew up in Fremont, California where she attended Mission San Jose High School. In high school she played clarinet in the marching band (spending several summers at band camp) and worked at Jamba Juice. 

= Her UC Davis activities =
Entering UC Davis Sapana lived in Quarto, Emerson grass-side and immediately fell in love with the school. She drove her friends crazy with her Davis-Pride, and quickly found outlets for this love both as a tour guide and on an ASUCD commission.

''Tour Guide:'' Sapana's sunny personality, confident nature, and knowledge of the campus made her an accomplished tour-guide. Not only was she elected "tour-guide of the month" (decided by tour-taker feedback) but numerous student were so inspired by her tours that they chose Davis based on her recommendation. Several current campus leaders, including Senator Brianna Haag and Brian McInnis were showed around the school by Sapana. 

''Commissioner:'' She took her position of the B&F commission very seriously, and after a year was elected vice chair. On B&F she was able to earn valuable experience on how to run an efficient meeting, and balance the budgetary needs of different student organizations. Most importantly, though, she also learned about the ASUCD budget becoming intimately familiar with it and the struggles of weighing different expenditures while keeping the best interests of the students at heart.


==Current Activities==
After gaining experience as a commissioner Shende knew she wanted to do more to give back to the school she loved. In winter '04 she ran for ASUCD Senate on the Student Focus slate. Since taking office she has authored and coauthored many important pieces of legislation, and has earned the respect of her colleagues. She was elected by the Senate for two terms as their President Pro-Tempora. The Pro-Tem runs the senate meetings. According to the ["ASUCD"] Constitution, the Pro-Temp serves as “the official representative of the ["Senate"] and shall assume all responsibilities enumerated in this Constitution and the statutes of the ["Senate"].” That sounds like a lot of work. 
  * ''This also means that when the ["ASUCD Vice President"] leaves the room, Sapana is the one who presides over the ["Senate"].''

Since her term will expire this winter Shende would like to continue to serve the school she loves, and use her experience as a tour-guide, commissioner, and Senator as the next ASUCD president. She is a candidate for ["ASUCD President"] in the Winter 2005 elections on the ["Student Focus"] ["Slate" slate].

Sapana is also the founder and president of the HDC.


=Personal Qualities=
