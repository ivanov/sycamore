''2005-01-22 04:22:47'' [[nbsp]] "modeled off the old Westmont Players Society, has selected Kalen Gallagher to be their public face, as the love affair that Rob Roy has with him saves DPS from any public scrutiny."  That doesn't quite make sense to me.  I didn't think ["Rob Roy"] had a love affair with Kalen..Also, the "modeled off the old Westmont Players Society" bit implies it was modeled off of it (which I'm guessing it was, but I have no idea -- ["KrisFricke" Kris Fricke] added that).  Also, I'm relatively sure that Kalen started the group.  This was an anonymous edit, anyway.. --["PhilipNeustrom"]

''This message is to the person posting as '''DpsElder-Counsel''':  If you compare versions, you'll note that this page has been becoming more and more neutral.  Nobody here will accept a blatantly anti-DPS page, but at the same time, it won't be a controlled mouthpiece for DPS. Yes, there is controversy... but that means that there are many sides to be presented.  I would highly suggest that, rather than deleting the page (which alerts any user of the site that has subscribed to the RSS feed), you simply present your side of things - leaving the opposing side up.  Make your own section if necessary, labeled "Official position" or something along those lines.  If somebody tries to delete your voice here, I'll personally reinstate it (as will several others).  Same goes if the anti-DPS voice is deleted. In short, yes... those people who don't like DPS will get a voice here... but '''so do you'''.  If you're confused, I highly recommend ["Wiki Ethics"] and reading about how the [http://en.wikipedia.com Wikipedia] works.  If you're still not convinced that there isn't a fair editor, consider that, as soon as you make a change... *you* are an editor, on equal ground with everybody else.'' -- ["JabberWokky"]

''2005-01-23 00:29:00'' [[nbsp]] This is a tough call. There's a lot of sweeping generalizations on this page that are hard to get around with the outsider's opinion of DPS. As someone who was formerly in a relationship with a current DPS member and attended the DPS Spring Formal, I think that a lot of the outsider perceptions of DPS are way off. Not all of the members are the typical "bro" that many envison, or claim themselves to be "the shit" nearly every time you talk to them. Don't be a player hater unless you have a valid reason. - ["AbbyLawson"] --["AbbyLawson"]


In light of the fact that only Abby Lawson seems to know any of the people, and everyone else is just speculating, I need to make some clarifications. First and foremost, Davis Player Society is not a group of players. It's supposed to be a joke, and that should be obvious considering that we would not go around announcing that we are players if we were actually trying to get some ass. No self-respecting girl would respond to that. You'd know that we aren't players if you went to any of Mr. Gallagher's farewell speeches, as he always thanks DPS, and says "But we're not really players... look at us... do we look like players?" You already missed three chances, but your fourth and final one is in March when he leaves office (There's a shameless plus, just for you KG). You guys are trying to be neutral, but it's clear that you have it in for the DPS, so here is my proposal: Come to our poker night. Talk to Kalen Gallagher, and he'll get you the information. Bring money.

I would write under my real name, but this is actually a group known as the DPS Council of Elders. How can the above be "what DPS is to many people (or looks like)," when nobody even knows what it is? Nobody has experienced a member of DPS actually going out and trying to get ass (because it doesn't happen), so it really can't look like we are... it's nothing but speculation and ignorance on your part. In fact, the "Player" could actually mean a poker player... I don't think you should delete all of this. People's comments should be allowed to stand... your biased ones included. ~DPS Council of Elders
  *'' No one is going to trust you if you use a fake name.''

It's not a fake name, I'm actually a member of the DPS Council of Elders. No one is going to trust your ticket if its acronym is FUCK. I wouldn't.
  ''It is not your name.''

I'm not a single person... multiple people often use this account and give input on what to post.

 * "I'm not a single person..."; "I would write ... but this is a group..." --  ''lol.  first person singular doesn't help your argument.'' - ["BrentLaabs"]

Only one person is typing at the keyboard at a time genius. This name represents many people, but only one person can really be doing the typing... it's simple physics really... two entities can't occupy the same space and the same time.
  
  ''but you can connect multiple keyboards to a single computer''

  * ''Admittedly I am familiar with the Pauli Exclusion principle, although it only applies to fermions.  I'm pretty sure you all aren't made out of bosons, so you're probably correct and cannot occupy the same quantum state as the rest of your council.  But seriously, when talking ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness Platform" on behalf of a group], it sounds more effective when you use the plural pronouns.  It's a good persuasive technique.'' - ["BrentLaabs"]

We'll certainly make note of that. You know, you all aren't very nice for a bunch of FUCKs.
