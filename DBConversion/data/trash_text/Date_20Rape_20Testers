From [http://watchyourdrink.com]:
 Watch Your Drink coasters were developed to help combat the crime of drug-facilitated sexual assault, more commonly known as 'Drug Rape'. On each coaster there are two separate testing areas. The coasters are simple to use; they are coated with a reactant that changes color to Blue if the 'Knock-Out Drug' (GHB, Roofies or Ketamine) is present. The test only takes seconds to perform, and is as easy as placing a couple of drops from the drink in question onto the active test spots by using a swizzle stick or even one's finger. 

The mere presence of the Watch Your Drink coaster will create an awareness of this growing problem throughout the world today. This is a special project by ["GASC"], we will be ordering and distributing these coasters soon.

If you work in a bar or live somewhere where ["Alcohol"] is plenty, consider distributing these coasters as a saftey precaution. To order, visit http://watchyourdrink.com/order.html
