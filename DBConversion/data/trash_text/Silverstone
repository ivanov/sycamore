Silverstone Apartments (a.k.a. Green Meadows)is a fairly large complex off of Pole Line north of Covell. It's a block away from the Nugget/Longs shopping center. The complex is near the Nugget playing fields, some ["Bike Paths" bike paths], and a small park with a basketball court. Living there also grants you the privilege of using their tiny pool.

["Unitrans"] line L has a stop there. It takes about 15 minutes to get to campus by bus and 20-30 minutes by bike. There is plenty of parking around also.
