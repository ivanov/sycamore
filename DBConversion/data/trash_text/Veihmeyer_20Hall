Veihmeyer is a building located right at the intersection of North Quad and California. Sometimes there are classes taught there, other times there is probably research or offices or what-ever.

Of primary interest to students is the fact that a cat lives in front of Veihmeyer hall, likely cared for by those faculty who work in or around Veihmeyer and are loyal to the feline resistance. In the following picture said cat is not present, though evidence of his or her existence is clear.
