Putah Creek is the primary drainage for the UC Davis campus, forming a not so vital link in the hydrologic cycle between mountain and sea, but a very vital link between mountain runoff and farmers. It's waters come from Lake Berryessa's Monticello Dam, flow through Winters, south of Davis, and terminate in the toe drain of the Yolo Bypass. Putah Creek's main channel was historically it's North Fork, which runs through campus (the present day UCD Arboretum). For flood control, the Army Corps of Engineers diverted all of the flow to the South Fork, which is obviously the new main channel. 

For more information on the natural and not-so-natural history of Putah Creek, see [http://bioregion.ucdavis.edu The Putah-Cache Bioregion Website].

There is a USGS web page with flow data at [http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/dv/?site_no=11454000&PARAmeter_cd=00060].

Putah Creek is a wonderful and close place to spend some time outdoors. There is decent bass fishing and great carp fishing in the section of creek from the UCD Picnic Area downstream to the stillwater below Old Davis Road. The bird watching is also quite good, as the riparian vegetation is an oasis for brids in a sea of treeless ag and urban lands. In spring, California State Endangered Swainson's Hawks use the creek's large trees for nesting. A majority of the northern levee of Putah Creek is open to the public. A few runners, bikers, and walkers have discovered this, but not many. More information about outdoor enjoyment on Putah Creek is still to come...

The North Fork of Putah Creek which "flows" through the UC Davis Arboretum enhances the beauty of the US Davis setting, despite the concrete walls. Lake Spafford is one of the many sites on this non-flowing section of waterway, near Mrak Hall. Every few years, this section of previously natural creek is drained for cleaning, and many stolen bicycles are recovered. All storm water runoff from the UCD campus ends up in the Arboretum. The new UC Davis Waste Water Treatment Plant discharges its effluent into the south branch of Putah Creek, just west of Old Davis Road. 

Many claim that "Putah" decends from a local Native American word. However, more amusement is generated from the fact that puta in Spanish means "whore".

''While it is technically possible to kayak from Winters to Davis several things should be noted: [[BR]]
1. Do so at your own risk with the understanding that this is a wild river with strainers and blind rapids. Flow is not constant, and subject to change.[[BR]] 
2. There are many blind corners, most of which are left handed. In fact an oddly high percentage of them are left handed.[[BR]] 
3. Depending on the time of year you may have to navigate through sections where the water flows under a surface logjam of trash and debris. Think the garbage compactor from Star Wars to get an idea of what that is like.[[BR]] 
4. The river will pull you through every blackberry bush it can. There is a lot of overhanging foliage ranging from trees that act as strainers to bushes with thorns.[[BR]] 
5. The narrowest stretch is between ["Interstate 80" I-80] and old davis road. [[BR]] 
6. There is at least one place where there is a large log just above the water. There are several areas that require a portage.[[BR]]
7. It takes all day, pack a lunch and wear your sunscreen.[[BR]]
8. All of these notes are subject to changes by Mother Nature.'' - ["JasonAller"]
