Chem 194 is one of the primary large lecture halls on campus. While technically part of the Chemistry building, because it can hold large numbers of people, it is used for a variety of classes as well as the occasional ["Movies" movie] or ["Robotmedia"] showcase.  

["Campus Cinema"] sponsors the ["Movies" movies] and sneak previews.   Information can be found  [http://asucd.ucdavis.edu/entertainment/campuscinema/ online] (although this is seldom up to date) or at the ["Memorial Union"].  Sneak Previews are '''FREE''', although popular ["Movies" movies] often require a properly acquired pass from the ["Memorial Union"].  Other films are generally $2-$5 and tickets are purchased (cash only) at the door.

Other large lecture halls include:
 * ["Social Science 1100"]
 * ["Haring 2205"]
 * ["Wellman 2"]
