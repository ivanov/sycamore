The Quad is a large patch of grass south of the ["Memorial Union" MU]. The Quad, as the name would imply, has four, approximately equal sides. It is also bisected by a narrow concrete path forming the East and West Quad.  At the end of this path is the ["Memorial Union: Flagpole" flagpole], which marks the beginning of the ["Memorial Union" MU]. Many extremely tall trees call the quad home, creating some shade for those who desire it.

In good weather, you can find any number of students studying, playing frisbee, napping, eating, or living on The Quad. Sometimes, perverts come to the quad to try and look down girl's shirts. Occasionally, campus police will have to run down some guy who is masturbating on the quad (see [http://www.californiaaggie.com/article/?id=3211 aggie article]). This is not a pleasant experience for anyone involved.

During the rainy season, The Quad turns into a giant puddle that people generally avoid. ["Alpha Gamma Omega"] has a tradition of going mud diving in the puddles on the quad after the first rainstorm of the school year.
