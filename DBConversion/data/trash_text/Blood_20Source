If you have to bleed on command, you couldn't ask for a more pleasant atmosphere in which to do it.  Blood Source is clean and bright and usually nicely decorated with seasonal themes (though I did complain that they didn't use vampires in their Halloween motif!).

The staff are all very pleasant and accommodating, clients donating plasma have a nice selection of television/movies to watch while they donate.  The snacks after donation are plentiful and include a nice selection from ["Fluffy Donuts"] next door.

Save a life.  Give blood!
