Central Park is located ["Downtown"] between B and C Streets, and is bounded by 3rd and 5th Streets on the south and north, respectively.  It has an adjacent parking lot.  The ["Third and B"] teen center is right in Central Park (sort of). The Central Park is also home to an old ["Lincoln Highway"] marker.

''once, I saw all these naked ["Hippies" hippie] children in that fountain.  I was really disturbed.'' - ["RohiniJasavala"]------
''2004-12-11 13:20:01'' [[nbsp]] If they were naked--how could you tell they were hippies? - ["BevSykes"]------
''2004-12-11 16:13:24'' [[nbsp]] The southern half of the park actually used to be an empty lot for years (was formerly the site of Davis' first elementary school). During those days, in the early years of the Whole Earth Festival, actual hippies used to park their VW campers there over the WEF weekend. It was also the starting point for the DHS Homecoming parade for many years. - ["CentralDavisite"]

''2004-12-11 16:41:08'' [[nbsp]] The empty lot was known for years as "The Arden-Mayfair lot" because at one time there was going to be an Arden-Mayfair built on it.  It took building 4th & B and the Farmer's Market to finally get people out of the habit of referring to it as the Arden Mayfair lot! - ["BevSykes"]

''2005-01-09 11:33:10'' [[nbsp]] I'm curious about why the photos were removed. --["BevSykes"]------
''2005-01-09 11:37:18'' [[nbsp]] Bev, there was concern about permission, you can see the comments using the info tab --["JasonAller"]------
''2005-01-09 15:32:10'' [[nbsp]] Someone was concerned that because the images contained children that they might be illegal to use.  Whether or not it's okay to use photos of children taken w/o their parents' permission is murky and someone expressed concern..If you knew the parents then I'd say put it back because it was a nice picture (deleted images are [http://daviswiki.org/image_backup/ stored here].)
