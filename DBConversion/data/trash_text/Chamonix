Serves typical espresso drinks, coffee, tea, shakes and sweets. Their Tea selection leaves much to be desired and their coffee is often stale. It sits in a thermos until it's empty. Quite often you go for some and either it's empty or it's no longer hot. They make mochas with chocolate syrup instead of real cocoa powder... Chamonix is pretty expensive. They charge $3.95 for pieces of frozen cake. Muffins for $2.25. Tea is $1.75. Small cookies are $0.55. 

== Atmosphere ==
Generally very quiet.  Every time I've been there, there has been very little talking.  Ideal for studying, not so much for chatting.  However, not the best place if you want a place with say, ''atmosphere''; it's a little lonely.  There is adequate space for books on the tables if it's just you... could get cramped with >1 person.  The bar along the window is good for laptops or using a single book... but not multiple books or laptop + books. They are very accommodating to people studying -- the whole cafe is usually filled with them.

The decor is silly Parisian kitsch. French people would laugh. The music played goes between French love songs and trendy pop bands like Maroon 5. Volume depends on who is working.

== Other services ==
Chamonix caters events.

They have a free, public access ["WiFi Hot Spots" wifi hotspot] (2.4 ghz, DSL speed).  There are power plugs underneath the long counter along the window, and a few plugs available on the back wall (but sometimes people are sitting in front of them).  The public-use ["LUGOD"] computer that was located here was removed when the ownership changed back in August 2004.

== Recommendations ==
Apple smoothie with caramel added in.  Costs about $3.25 plus tip.  You '''do''' tip, right? - ["PaulLanzi"]
