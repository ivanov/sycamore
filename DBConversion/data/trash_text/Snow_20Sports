["Davis"] is a great place to live if you like ["Snow"] but don't want to live smack in the middle of it all winter. ["Lake Tahoe"] resorts are 1.5-2 hours away in good weather without traffic.
== Tahoe Ski Resorts ==
 * [http://www.skialpine.com Alpine Meadows]
  - Alpine is a favorite of many hard riding locals because of the varied terrain, good vibes and inbounds backcountry.
 * [http://www.borealski.com Boreal]
  - Boreal is the closest resort to ["Davis"] and only costs $10 for college students on Fridays. Boreal is a small resort so it is best for beginners or people who want to ride their killer terrain parks. 
 * [http://www.diamondpeak.com/ Diamond Peak]
 * [http://www.donnerskiranch.com Donner Ski Ranch]
  - Donner Ski Ranch is located close to Boreal and Sugar Bowl. It is a small and cheap resort that is best suited for beginners. Although it does have some nice cliffs to drop off of on powder days. 
 * [http://www.skiheavenly.com/ Heavenly]
 * [http://www.skihomewood.com/ Homewood]
  - Homewood is located right on the West Shore of Lake Tahoe so it has amazing views. It is small and fairly cheap but still has some steepish terrain and nice lines. Locals like it on powder days when the roads to the other resorts are hard to access. 
 * [http://www.kirkwood.com Kirkwood]
  - Kirkwood is one of the best resorts in Tahoe. Located on Highway 88, away from the rest of the area it takes a little bit longer to access that many resorts. The terrain is steep, the parks are good and the snow is usually fantastic due to the high elevation. Many advanced rides enjoy The Wood. 
 * [http://www.mtrose.com/ Mount Rose]
 * [http://www.northstarattahoe.com Northstar-at-Tahoe]
  - Jokingly reffered to as "Flatstar", Northstar's front side is pretty darn easy. The resort over-rates their runs, turning blue squares in to black diamonds and greens in to blues. The Backside and Lookout Peak offer nice terrain for intermediate and above skiers. One nice thing is that there aren't as many good people that ride here so powder can be found well in to the afternoon if you know where to look after a storm.
 * [http://www.sierratahoe.com Sierra-at-Tahoe]
 * [http://www.squaw.com Squaw Valley USA]
  - Squaw Valley, home of the 1960 Winter Olympics, is one of the largest resorts in the area. It attracts many of the regions most devoted ski bums due to the world class terrain. It is quite expensive and can be very crowded. The vibe can seem a little pretentious.
 * [http://www.sugarbowl.com Sugar Bowl]
  - Sugar Bowl is one of the closets resorts to Davis because you don't have to cross Donner Pass. It hosts great snow, nice steeps and plenty of terrain. While the parks usually suck, that is not why one goes to the bowl. This is an excellent resort.
== Central/Southern Sierra Resorts ==
 These resorts are a VERY long way away from Davis.
 * [http://www.mammothmountain.com Mammoth Mountain]
 * [http://www.junemountain.com June Mountain]
 * [http://www.bearvalley.com/ Bear Valley]
 * [http://www.sierrasummit.com/ Sierra Summit]
== Clubs and Organizations ==
 * ["Outdoor Adventures"] - runs cross country skiing, ski mountaineering, snowshoeing, Yosemite snowcamping and snowcave building courses
 * ["SOS"] is the largest club on ["Campus"] and it's main goal is to help students to go skiing or snowboarding.
 * ["Snowboard Team"]
 * ["Ski Team"] 
== Tahoe Deals ==
 If you plan to ski/ride a lot, it is best to buy a season pass. Many resorts offer slightly restricted passes for only $200-300. It is best to buy early before the offers expire (sometimes before ["UC Davis"] starts Fall Quarter.)
 * Members of ["SOS"] get pretty good discounts on various tickets, tuneups and equipment.
 * [http://www.snowbomb.com/ Snowbomb] is a good place to get deals through. Their Tahoe Card can be a good value.
 * [http://www.slidingonthecheap.com/deals/ SlidingOnTheCheap.com] - lists ticket deals
 * [http://www.borealski.com Boreal] - Every Friday lift tickets are only $10 for college students. 
== Cheap places to stay ==
 During the winter, most people want to stay indoors when in the mountains. Camping or sleeping in your car is still an option for those ["Living Cheaply"]. People often stay in a friend's cabin or share a hotel room.

 * ["Ski Team" Ski Team Cabin] - If you're in the loop, anyone can stay at the team cabin for $10 a night.
 * ["Snowboard Team" Snowboard Team Cabin] -  Again, if you're in the loop, anyone can stay at the team cabin for $10 a night.
 * ["SOS" SOS Cabin] - Same as above
 * ["Cal Lodge"] - Owned but not operated by the students of UC Berkeley, anyone can stay at this bunkhouse near Sugar Bowl for $20 a night. 
== Transportation ==
 * ["SOS"] helps members find rides up to the snow.
 * ["Amtrak"] - trains or buses drop you off in Truckee, far away from any resort
== Places to get gear ==
 * ["Big 5 Sporting Goods"]
 * ["Ground Zero Boardshop"]
 * ["Ken's Bike & Ski"]
 * ["Outdoor Adventures"] - rents Cross Country skis, Telemark skis and Snowshoes. Doesn't rent downhill stuff.
== Backcountry Skiing Information ==
 * [http://www.bobskiing.com/links.htm Bob's Links] - All the links you need and want
 * [http://avalanche.org/ avalanche.org] - current advisories on snow stability
 * [http://www.csac.org/Bulletins/#California California Avalanche conditions] - More informative than above link
