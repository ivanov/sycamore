Excellent place to buy random surplus electronics.  Not guaranteed to have what you want (especially if "what you want" was made within the last seven years,) but they've got some of the most arcane stuff I've ever seen, with reasonable prices.  And they're willing to bargain.

If you like this place, you may also like ["HSC Electronics"].

(Nb: This address is no longer accurate. They moved around the corner, to the white building approximately 120 meters east-by-southeast of the old location, as the crow flies.  They share it with a boat repair shop, if that helps.)

Run by a guy named Ali, who's a hard bargainer.  Make sure to test anything as much as you can before leaving the store.  - ["TarZxf"]
