This is a glossary of Davis terms. Feel free to add davis lingo or slang. Somebody might want to rename this page "Davis Slang" or "The Davis Lexicon" or something along those lines, but I think glossary works well for now. This will be sort-of like a slang dictionary, but davis specific. Something that would be helpful to say... someone from socal, or the east coast.
