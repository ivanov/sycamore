= The Breakdown =

Out of state students are a rare breed in Davis, they make up 3% of the undergraduate population. Even international students outnumber them at 4%,  quite a commanding lead.

Many out of state students feel bitter for having to pay nearly three times as much as California residents (for *tuition* that is), in addition to paying extra money spent on transportation to visit their homeland far, far away over vacation. The total amount that the average California resident living on campus pays per year (including books,  student fees, insurance, personal expenses, etc.) is about $21,231 compared to the non-resident who pays a whopping $23,892 in fees not including housing etc. These numbers were taken from [http://why.ucdavis.edu/finances/fees.cfm here].

In addition to having to pay more to attend UC Davis, out of state students are required to jump through additional rings of fire just to be admitted to the university. Out of state students are required to have a 3.4 (unweighted) minimum GPA when applying for admission, while in comparison, residents are required to have a 2.8 minimum GPA. Out of state students are required to have SAT scores of at least 1400, while resident requirement is lower (couldn't find the exact number). This information was taken from [http://why.ucdavis.edu/admissions/froshAdmReq.cfm#nonCA_residents here].


== The Cons ==

There are other trite frustrations we face, but some are kind of funny:
 * When showing ID, many people stop dead in their tracks if they don't see the oh-so-familiar California driver's license and assume that the out of state ID must be a fake one, or is inadequate. 
 * When stopped in the quad and being asked to sign some petition for a worthy cause that is only for registered California voters, yet they fail to tell you that before you start filling out the form.
 * Being asked, "So what part of California are you from?" <- the ultimate insult


== The Pros ==

Despite our bitching, we have some advantages too:
 * Killer conversation starter, most people  you meet don't get to say they are from 2,000 miles away.
 * The California budget crisis doesn't affect us (as much).
 * If approached in the quad and asked to sign a petition for an *unworthy* cause we have the perfect excuse for saying no.
 * Our cars have neato license plates.

= In Summary =

Though some out of staters tend to be bitter sometimes about tuition costs and whatnot, if you ask them, they'll most likely say that they are happy at ["UC Davis"]. After all, there must be a good reason that they left their home state in the first place, right?

''2005-01-27 15:44:35'' [[nbsp]] Take note though. There is a secret/devious way to avoid the out of state tution if you dare. OH, and I didnt get the 1400, but I'm from outta state..how does that work?  --["MattJojola"]------
''2005-01-27 18:23:02'' [[nbsp]] I feel like a lot of out-of-state undergrads, especially those from eastern states, end up at UCD because of the USNews college rankings.  A number of them have told me that they saw UCD ranked near schools they were considering, checked out the website, and decided to apply.  For such a major university, UCD is relatively unknown outside the West.  Also, it seems like most out-of-staters from the West are engineering majors. --["RishiTrivedi"]
