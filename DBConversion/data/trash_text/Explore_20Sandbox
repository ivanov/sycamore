A place for experimenting with the "Explore" sidebar on the front page.
[[BR]]

My original clustering of topics by broad subject, is apparently falling apart on the front page.  While in my original revamp there were a few things that were more "gag" pages (like cows, hot sauce, meat market), there's stuff that should be sub-topic-of-a-subtopic stuff popping up on the main explore page:  barber shops, nimby, ...  maybe there should be a page that organizes davis philosophical-political issues, a page for services (like barber shops), and a page for religion (so you can put places of worship, religions, whatever),..  just a thought.   Maybe we should have an organization party so we can bring more quality content closer to the top level... some things are not as well placed as they should be.  -["JaimeRaba" jr]

Ken, James -- I put ["Spiritual Organizations"] inside of ["Organizations"] instead of ["Explore"].  If I were looking for a religious place I would look at Organizations?  I think we might need a massive rehaul of Explore come the creation of ["UC Davis"], ["Davis"] and a few more general pages. My concern is that while a catalog of churches is useful, there's a lot w/o pages right now and the few that do have very little outgoing links.  I think the page ought to be in Explore in a bit, but maybe not right now. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]

Can we add ["Hotels"] to this? -- ["KenBloom"]
  * I think the wiki should strive to be the best resource for folks ''in'' davis, not nec. a tourism thing.  Maybe we can collect tourist/visiting things into a page and throw it on explore.  Besides, that Hotels page has only one new outgoing link right now.
    * Can you think of anything else tourist-related (besides Hotels)? And the Hotels page will presumably get edited and filled in with links. Part of the reason for this page is to make people notice. (And of course I'll add some infos) -- ["KenBloom"]

'''questions/concerns''':  I think LSA, GSA should be on Explore, but as of now they don't link to much.  They're both fantastic or soon to be fantastic, but I think they should link to a great deal of pages (if possible), because Explore is supposed to be a starting point.  I'd help out but I don't know anything about either organization :)  Even links to sort of silly things would be good, because it's likely that a law student or a graduate student would first click on GSA or LSA, seeing it there.  - ["PhilipNeustrom"]

I think that this is a good start, but there seems to be the problem of wanting to just throw in a page that's good just because it's good -- not because it's really in the right spot.  I'd say our reorganization of ["Explore"] needs to wait for probably 50 or so more pages in the wiki.  Right now, I'm going to spend my time instead making sure all our pages are linked up well and organized in a general->less general->specific->more specific manner.  I.E. we have ["Frat Parties"], ["free beer"], but no ["Parties"] and ["Drinking"] pages.  Just my 0.02 - ["PhilipNeustrom"]

I totally agree.  But, I also think that people who would love the site if they clicked on the right pages might give up on the site when it seems completely geared towards each section of town.  I actually didn't necessarily choose the BEST pages to put in there, but just ones that linked to lots of other ones, or were at least exciting.  I know they're sometimes "sub-classes", but I figure as far as utility goes, I think it would get people more excited about the site.  Sometimes, I think the less exploratory indivual gives up one daviswiki when it just seems like another Davis411, which perhaps the "breakdown by city area" might suggest to the unitiated.  The page of the day does a lot to despell that notion, but the explore setup does not at all reflect where the dominant amount of content is.  Is there any way to see what the most content-heavy pages are right now, just out of curiosity?   - jr

 Jaime, we took your general layout from attempt #2, beefed it up a touch, and moved things around so as to focus on more interesting pages first.  Thanks a ton for your work and suggestions, it made it so much easier. - ["MikeIvanov"]
