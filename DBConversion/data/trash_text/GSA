= Overview =
GSA, The Graduate Student Association, is similar to the House of Representatives for ["Grad Students" graduate students].  ["Grad Students" Grad students] pay a student fee every quarter that funds the GSA.  The GSA in turn, distributes this money among various programs and functions, and provide funding for graduate departmental events as well.  The GSA representatives are the people who vote, and hence collectively the decision maker.  The number of representatives each department can have is quantized proportional to the number of full-time ["Grad Students" grad students] enrolled the respective department in the previous Spring.

Check the [http://gsa.ucdavis.edu/ Official UC Davis GSA Website] to find out who are representing your department, or if there are vacant positions still.

=== Campus Council for Information Technology ===

Caroline Bledsoe from the Campus Council for Information
Technology came and gave a presentation.  It serves an
advisory role on the various IT issues on campus.  She
solicited feed back from the GSA reps, among which were
(non-exhaustive list):
 * need better spam filter
 * UC Davis website design sucks
 * possibility of webcasting recorded lectures
 * more wireless coverage

If you have comments or questions for this council, ask your GSA reps!

=== Special Project Funding Request - Bike Dome ===

Two graduate students drafted up a proposal to build a bike
dome near the graduate housing area, and requested $500
from the GSA Special Project Fund to help offset the cost
(they need approximately $3500 total).

The bike dome will a community bike shop "where anyone can
bring their bike in and figure out how to get it running
smoothly."  With an emphasis on community and teaching
people how to maintain & fix their own bikes, it will stand
out from the bike barn and other bike store in Davis.

Based on the considerations of the service this project
would provide, the GSA voted to grant $500 to offset the
cost of setting up the Bike Dome.

Ask your GSA reps if you have questions or want to know
more details.

=== Graduate Student Resource Center Proposal ===

During the October meeting, the Dean of Graduate Studies
came, and presented to us a plan for a Graduate Student
Community Center.  It'd be a building centrally located on
campus, for graduate students specifically, and will
provide various essential services for graduate students. 
A 17-page proposal is available for anyone who is
interested for more details.

Currently this center is still in the "visionary" stage,
still need funding and approval of other authorities in the
bureaucratic food chain.  The GSA voted in support of this
proposal, urging the Dean of Graduate Studies to continue
the compaign to fund and build the center, with continuing
input from the graduate student community.

=== Misc ===

Currently, the Davis ["City Council"] voting rights do not
cover UC Davis students who live on campus.  The GSA
External Chair is trying to do something about it.  If you
are interested in this matter, please contact us.

GSA is redesigning its website http://gsa.ucdavis.edu/ and
can use some input.  Send feed back to gsa@ucdavis.edu

== Funding for Graduate Student Organizations? ==
GSA is considering the possibility of providing funding to Graduate Student Organizations.  Although there are a handful of Graduate Student Organization already registered through SPAC, they are not eligible to apply for Club Finance Council Funding. 

The first meeting to discuss this issue took place Tuesday, October 19th.  GSA is actively trying to get feed back from leaders of graduate student clubs/organizations.  Please email gsa@ucdavis.edu to get in touch with GSA.

= Department Funding =
While each department can have a number of representatives roughly proportional to the number of students it has, not every department sends as many reps as they can.  To encourage even representation of every student within GSA, funding that goes back to each department is calculated thus:

(Total Funding to Departments) x (# of Reps Sent By The Department) / (Total # of GSA Representatives)
