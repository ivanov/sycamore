Above is the map of Downtown featured on the "Discover Downtown Davis" brochures you can find scattered about Downtown.  It is largely what is agreed upon ''is'' Downtown:  the dense collection of local businesses that lies where the lettered streets intersect with the numbered streets.  Downtown Davis is cute, it's sweet, and it's quiet.
