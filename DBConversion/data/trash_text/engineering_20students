Stereotypically geeky, engineering students dedicate themselves in their 4+ years at UCD taking classes that (for the most part) have been planned out for them for their whole undergraduate career.  There is little room for exploration into other majors as engineering majors are generally 180 units, the first chunk of which are math and science classes.  There is a good amount of competition as well as camaraderie in the classes and labs, as many students practically live in ["EUII"].  Many do not survive the ["Weeder Classes" weeder classes] and switch to other majors.  Of those that do, many expect to make lots of money to make up for the lost time and social life.

Many people do not expect engineering students to be able to communicate effectively.  Because of this, they are forced to take a communications class.  After taking the Communications 3, some engineering students are convinced that the communications department is a load of crap and teaches people that they don't need logic or truth, only that they need to keep people happy with tact and bullshit.  Communication students and engineering students may very well be natural enemies.
