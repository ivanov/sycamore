''Bum, Bum, You've Been Here Before'' was created in 1967 by Tio Giambruni.  From 1969 until 1976 it was on ["Russell"] Blvd.  It was then moved to the central ["Campus"].  People don't sit on it nearly as often as they should.

This is one of the weirder looking sculptures on ["Campus"].

If you look closely at it, you see the text "BUM, BUM, YOU'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE" written in various places on it.
