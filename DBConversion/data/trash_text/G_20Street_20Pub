Depending on what night of the week it is, the scene at G Street Pub can vary quite a lot.  In its history, the location has transitioned from a very fancy restaurant (["A. J. Bumps"]) to a ["biker bar"] to the well-worn all-purpose drinking spot that it now is.  G Street pub is all-purpose in the sense that it has a spacious pool area, routinely hosts a variety of live bands, has ["karaoke night"], and even has an open mic-night.  [See the entry for ["Night Time" night time] for more info on the particulars of each night.]  There is a "pub" atmosphere created mostly by extremely dim lighting, and the pours here can sometimes be generous.  The ["Decent Well Liquor" well liquor] is to be avoided -- remember to call your brand.

Wednesday:  No cover, dollar pints of Pabst and Miller Lite, $2 wells (see above).
