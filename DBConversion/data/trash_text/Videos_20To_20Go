Videos To Go is cheap. The cheapest Video rental place in davis, besides the library that is. You can rent VHS for a dollar, and DVD for two dollars. Its fucking ridiculous. Their selection of new releases isn't that great, but if you have a VCR and want to watch an old movie that you know for certain doesn't come in DVD form, (and even if it does it wouldn't have any DVD extras), then this is your place.

If you can't remember the name of that hip and interesting title you were hoping to mention at ["Cafe Roma" Roma] was, try their "what's hot" section - it isn't necessarily the newest, and it isn't necessarily the oscarest, but it's usually good stuff.
