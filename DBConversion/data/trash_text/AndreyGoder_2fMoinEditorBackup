The Integrated Studies Honors Program is designed to help "high-achieving students" integrate knowledge from various fields of study and learn in a small classroom environment. It is for first-year students only, and entry is only by invitation. Students take three four-unit classes and two one-unit seminars over the course of the year. They all have less than twenty-five students, so it provides a different perspective from most freshman classes.

Examples of IS courses:

 * The Scientific Study of Consciousnes
 * Inequality
 * Science in the Renaissance
 * Storytelling
 * Americans Debate Their Rights
 * Globalization
 * Biophotonics

One of the nice perks is that they get to live in the new dorms in ["Segundo North"], in ["Miller Hall"].
