Well, it's just a scale.  It's free, accessible 24 hours a day, accurate, can fit multiple people and their favorite objects . . . really nothing more to say.

Sounds nice, but I can think of one more thing to say... ''How about its location?''  Yes after searching I see that it's on the map, but it still might be nice to include the location on the page text.  It appears to be near ["Cruess Hall"].
