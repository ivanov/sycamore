They are also right on the ["Unitrans" B-line and G-line], which is quite convenient for UCD students, even though you share the B-line with ["Cuarto"] freshmen residents.[[BR]][[BR]] '''2 Bedroom Townhouse:''' 2 bedrooms, 1.5 baths, 978 square feet[[BR]] '''2 Bedroom Flat:''' 2 bedrooms, 1.5 baths, 918 square feet[[BR]][[BR]]''(photo from [http://davisrentalhotline.com davisrentalhotline.com], where you can find some more info)''||

''I'm not sure about the rent for the flats, but for the townhouse as of this year (2004-2005), the rent is $1115/mo, after you sign a 11 month and a half contract. Laundry is $1/washing, $1/drying (3 of each washer/dryer in each facility), also an increase from last year. But the amenities include jacuzzi, a pool (though it's not very heated) and pretty good parking (no trouble finding spaces though there are no reserved spots). Also be aware, the management can be a bitch sometimes, it's best to follow regulations carefully or else she can really get to you. Also you have to accept the fact the apartments are kind of old, so don't complain about the pests or the crappy insulation. Hey, at least there is decent heating.'' - ["YawenChen"]
