me and a good friend.  i'm on the left.

My name is not "Fighter".  Nor is my last name "Plane" in any sense of the word.  My name is in fact "Katherine Delwiche," which is delightfully Belgian, though I am not quite as Belgian as I might like to be.  I come from a little town called Nevada City - a town containing a cluster of human beings and a steady supply of passionate creativity, both of which i have fallen sickeningly in love with.  Despite this elicit romance with my hometown, I now find myself separated from it as some little part of my soul tries pathetically to hold on.  Strangely enough, this seems to be a reoccuring event in my life.

All I really want to do is enact an individual social experiment where I disappear from all that I have ever known for a given block of time (a year, for example) and wander europe and feel intense fear and loneliness - but the opposites of these as well.  no expectations from others, no emotional ties... because i will have broken those for myself.  and freedom.
