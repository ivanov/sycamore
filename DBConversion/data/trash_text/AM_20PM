The Davis AMPM sits on the intersection of ["Russell"] and ["Anderson Rd." Anderson] across the street from ["Campus" campus] and Rite Aid.  They sell the usual junk food (hot dogs, chips, etc) typical of ["Gas Stations" gas stations].  It's about as far as some clueless ["Freshmen" freshmen] wander in search of something to do while ["Procrastinating" procrastinating] ["Night Time" late at night].  


-Fondly refered to as "The AM-P" while I was a freshman
the site of many a 1:55 AM 40oz runs and drunken muchie purchaces such as "Chili Chese Fritos" and "Flaming Hot Cheetos"


-Also you are bound to be "["Shoulder tapping" shoulder tapped]" for booze, by freshmen, if you in anyway resemble a person of age!
