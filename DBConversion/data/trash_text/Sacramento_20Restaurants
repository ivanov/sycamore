||'''Comments:'''||
''I personally recommend PF Chang's, Thai Basil, Hamburger Mary's, Rick's Dessert Diner (2322 K St.) awesome diner atmosphere and seven layer cakes (mmm) and Mikuni Sushi to name a few - ["KristenBirdsall"]''

''["JaimeRaba" jr's] favorites: Tapa the World (Spanish tapas), Firehouse (fancy steak/seafood/california), Marika (hungarian food), Elephant Bar, Fox and Goose Pub (British food), Buca di Beppo (the best for a big group.) Random cheap(er) eats: Spaghetti Factory (good for big groups), Gold Rush Grille (2nd floor of Secretary of State's office—amazingly good however), Rubios (awesome Baja-style fish Tacos)''

''["RobRoy"] Suggests Adalberto's Mexican Foods 7400 Fair Oaks Blvd Carmichael, CA Phone: (916) 483-6345. It is damn good. Its so good the doorway might as well have an ISN Agent. And they are so authentic they don't even have a website. ["JabberWokky"] seconds the suggestion and adds that Adalberto owns several restaurants in the greater Sacramento area and that his wife, Carolina, has a few too (named after her), which are equally good (and remarkably similar). They are all tiny and authentic with cheap and very very good food.''
