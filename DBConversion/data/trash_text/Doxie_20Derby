The Doxie Derby is the dachshund race that takes place every year during ["Picnic Day"]. It's incredibly well-attended, and people get way too excited (as do the dogs). There are both regular and mini-dachshund categories, and the races are hilarious to watch. There are actually people out there who ''train'' their dogs to compete in this thing.

The races take place in ["Rec Hall" the Pavillion at ARC], formerly known as the ["Rec Hall"], and an innovation last year was the "doxiecam," which was attached to the head of one of the little dachshunds, and would play footage on the scoreboard screen.

TIP: Get there early, as the races closer to the beginning are much more fun, with dogs running all over the place, and owners doing everything possible to get them to go where they're supposed to.
