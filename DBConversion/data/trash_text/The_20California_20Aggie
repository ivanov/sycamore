Serving the UC Davis campus and community since 1915, The California Aggie is the official campus newspaper.  It is official in so far as it is everywhere -- it can be found in every corner of campus, in front of most major lecture halls, and even in a lot of community locations outside of campus.  The Aggie, as it is affectionately referred to, receives no financial support from ["ASUCD"].  It's free, assuming you pick up a copy from someplace.  If you're a business or just highly inclined, you can subscribe and mail subscriptions are $100 per academic year, $35 per quarter and $25 for the summer.

The California Aggie editorial board is made up of the eleven editors at the newspaper. Twice a week, Tuesday and Thursday, editorials are written that make up the collective opinion of the editors regarding a range of topics..
