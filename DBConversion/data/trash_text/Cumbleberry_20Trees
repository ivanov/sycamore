As request by ["RishiTrivedi"], there are some curious trees behind ["Empty House"] and surrounding that neighborhood's park.

For those familiar with the strange aroma that wafts amongst these trees, its been rumored to smell akin to ejaculate.  Hence, the term "Cumbleberry".

What is the genus of the tree? And why does it smell so bad? Its quite the unpleasant bike ride along the Halsey Circle bike path from Safeway.

''Aren't those trees called "society garlic?"'' -["JaimeRaba" jr]

''Maybe they are gingko trees?  Those can smell really bad sometimes.'' -["RohiniJasavala"]

''I could have sworn those were carob trees, but I checked [http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_363.html The Straight Dope] and it seems to be that there are a bunch of different trees that are reputed to smell like semen. It could be a tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), a chestnut (Castanea sp.), a carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua) or a California privet.'' -["AmyZimmerman"]
