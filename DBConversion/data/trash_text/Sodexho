Sodexho, offically Sodexho/Mariott is the largest food service provider in America. Most of what they cook is generally considered to... be... not that great. Except for the ["Tercero Dining Commons"], their stuff is pretty good. They run the campus ["Dining Commons"], ["The Silo"], the ["Scrubs"] cafe, and the cafe at the ["ARC"]. 

Sodexho is also available as a [http://catering.ucdavis.edu/ catering service] for various campus events.

At one point there was a movement by Sodexho employees seeking university employment (and thus university benefits), but it didn't go very far.
