Right across the street from ["The Marketplace"], Pepperwood Apartments sit comfortably on the corner of Sycamore and Alvarado. Though one of the older apartments built in Davis, Pepperwood is one the best kept secrets. Prices are decent. Cathy, the manager is responsive to tenants' needs for maintenance (not that you'll really need it ''that'' often). The area is pretty quiet. And there are not just one, but two ["Unitrans" G-line] bus stops nearby for Pepperwood residents to pick from.

The apartment complex consists mostly of simple 2- & 3-bedroom townhouses, each with a humble kitchen, spacious downstairs living room/dining room, and small patio (for bikes!). [[BR]][[BR]]
