An ["ASUCD"] political party that has yet to win a seat on the ["ASUCD"] ["Senate"]. The Friends Urging Campus Kindness ["Slate" slate] evolved from the ["SOSSS"] slate that ran in the Fall 2004 elections. In Winter 2005 they are running ["Rob Roy"] as their ["Choice Voting" top choice] ["Senate"] candidate.

It is a ["Slate" slate] with '''["Friends Urging Campus Kindness Issues" real issues]''' and a  '''["Friends Urging Campus Kindness Platform" platform]'''.

[[TableOfContents]]

= General Information =
The ["Slate" slate] began the early stages of its campaign during the very first day of Winter quarter, 2005. and began speaking to groups, tabling, and producing campaign flyers and t-shirts during the second week.  The Friends Urging Campus Kindness ["Slate" slate] is attempting to get as many people as they can to run under their ["Slate" slate] in order to maximize their chances of getting ''at least one'' person elected.  They intend to do this by collecting a number of people interested in running for ["Senate"] and having them say something along the lines of, "Vote ["Rob Roy"] #1 and vote me #2."  Because of the use of ["Choice Voting"] in ["ASUCD"] elections, the number of people running in a election doesn't 'poison' the vote (e.g. the Ralph Nader factor in the 2000 US Presidential election).

== Candidates and Staff ==
The ["Slate" slate] is absolutely encouraging a vote of #1 for ["Rob Roy"].  In addition, the following other candidates are running:

 * ["TeresaKenny" Teresa Kenny]
 * ["Pete Hernandez" Pete "Pedro" Hernandez] who ran in the last election and promised to "make your wildest dreams come true."
 * ["KristenBirdsall" Kristen Birdsall]
 * ["RevChad" Rev. Chad Van Schoelandt] who ran in the last election with ["SOSSS"]
 * ["Yahya Rouhani"]
 * ["PaulIvanov" Paul Ivanov]
 * ["JonDsouza" Jon D'souza]
 * ["Andrew Leonardo Bianchi"]
 * ["DanReilly" Daniel Reilly]
 * ["AllanRae" Allan Rae] 
 * ["ScottRitchie" Scott Ritchie]
 * ["AishaNouh" Aisha Nouh]

They support a few independent candidates, specifically:
 * ["AviSingh" Avanindar "Avi" Singh]
 * ["Jonathon Leathers"]
 * Eric Fox
 * Friends Urging Campus Kindness also supports the troops

For the Presidential race, they have decided to support the ["L.E.A.D."] candidates who have been very helpful to the Friends in making election reform. "These particular Leadites are considered good people, so vote for them".

They also have a list of campaign managers which includes:
 * ["BrentLaabs" Brent Laabs] who was a campaign manager for ["SOSSS"] last election
 * ["ChrisRood" Chris Rood] who ran in the last election with ["SOSSS"]
 * ["Anthony Parisi"] who was a ["SOSSS"] groupie in the last election
 * ["MarieHuynh" Marie Huynh] who ran in the last election with ["SOSSS"]

They have two campaign advisors giving advice on the crucial issues in the swing frats.
 * ["Paul Amnuaypayoat"] who is a ["Davis College Libertarians" Libertarian] and ["Agnostic and Atheist Student Association" Atheist], so does't really believe in anything.
 * ["BarnabasTruman" Barnabas Truman] who represents the opinions of the Ancient Order of Walkers.

Note that there is no head campaign manager, resulting in much chaos and furthering the myth that this ["Slate" slate] is composed of a bunch of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordian discordians]. They have no official relation to the ["Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion"], not that such an organization exists or anything.

Most importantly, their official mascot is ["Yev"], also nicknamed "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkers_speech Checkers]".

...This is not a finalized list. More will be added soon. Most of these people have been in the same room by now.

== Contact the Slate ==

The ["Slate" slate] has begun having "Office Hours on the Quad," an idea which many past senate candidates have promised. 

["Rob Roy for Senate" Rob Roy]'s Office Hours: Tuesdays Noon to 2pm,Wednesdays Noon to 1pm and Thursdays Noon to 2pm. [[BR]]["KristenBirdsall" Kristen Birdsall] has office hours from 1pm to 2pm on Thursdays. 

Look for the "Friends Urging Campus Kindness" towel taped to a table. A major goal of this tabling activity is to talk to students and find out what issues are important to them, and use this information to for a "Platform of the People." Friends Urging Campus Kindness also uses this time to make campaign shirts for anyone who brings them a shirt to spray paint with one of their selection of stencils and many color options.

You can e-mail them at {{{sosss05@hotmail.com}}} [[BR]]

= Issues =

["Friends Urging Campus Kindness Issues"] is an official list of what the slate supports in student government.

For a more in depth discussion of these issues, consult the ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness Platform"].

These issues can be summed up in three important points:

 * Open and Accessible Student Government
 * Services for All Students
 * Emphasize Good Business Practices

Many of the members have worked on Election Reform Bills to correct problems witnessed in the Fall 2004 election. This bill was passed by the ["Senate" senate] unanimously. They aren't even in the ["Senate" senate] and have already gotten an important bill passed.

= Acronym =
The ["Slate" slate's] name was chosen because it forms the acryonym "F.U.C.K." and ["RevChad"] wanted to know if the ["California Aggie"] would acryonize it like they do with ["LEAD" L.E.A.D.]  The answer to this is no, as explained in [http://www.californiaaggie.com/article/?id=7100 Ryan Fuller's column] in the ["California Aggie"].
