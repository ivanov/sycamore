The town of Davis contains three water towers, what being for the dissemination of delightful tasting ["Tap Water" Davis tap water] to its residents. They also contribute to the small-town aesthetic that makes Davis oh so very popular with the kids.

Left-to-right, these are:

The fashionable "UCDavis" water tower, located by the scenic ["Arboretum"] and also some buildings.

The off-campus one; stationed ''suspiciously'' adjacent to Davis's Mormon church type establishment.

The rather puny tower emblazoned with the ["Oldschool Aggie Logo"]. It's near the cow milking facilities on campus.

The left and right towers above are UC Davis owned water-towers. There are also some other water towers in Davis.  These other water towers are much more spooky, being operated by monsters and goblins rather than mere mortal men.

Hiding behind masses of trees somewhere a few streets off of ["Russell"], the above water tower sits, lonely and full of water.

If you're talking about the one on West 8th (Which is indeed "a few streets off ["Russell"]", that's the Mormon watchtower I mentioned, what with it being directly adjacent to the Mormon church. Either that or there's one much further down Russell that looks almost exactly the same. Whatever. Nice Picture though. -- ["TravisGrathwell"]

Took this photo my freshman year ('01-'02) of the "Old School" water tower near the dairy facility.  Kinda pretty. --["KayRide"]
