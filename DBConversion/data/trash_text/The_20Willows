The Willows is a complex on Lake and Covell across from the Circle K gas station. Rent is on the cheaper side (~1400 for 3/2), on par with most other west davis apartments, and the apartments are quite nice. Apartments are fairly roomy, and the grounds are very well kept. The staff is excellent: response times are usually the same day, everyone is very friendly and helpful. Parking is pretty good before midnight, otherwise street parking is free. The pool and workout room are decent, but there's also a banquet room that can be reserved by residents. Willows residents can also join the ["Stonegate Country Club"] for a mere $10/month.

However, the only bus line that goes to the Willows is the P/Q. Broadband internet has just recently been made available to the complex. The complex is also very quiet, but the neighbors aren't the most social people.
