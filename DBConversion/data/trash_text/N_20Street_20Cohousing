The N Street Co-Housing is one of the more interesting co-opie things in Davis. Years ago about 10-12 houses on N-Street all agreed to remove their backyard fences to create a private community area. They now have a community house and lots of gardens and play structures for their children.

Their web site is located at ("http://www.nstreetcohousing.org/").

I will add more info soon. - ["DanMasiel"]
