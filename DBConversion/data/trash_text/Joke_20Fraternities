We've heard of some pretty strange fraternity/sorority names around here, which may or may not exist.
Usually their name is an acronym for something, or spells something out when you read the names of the letters. For example:
 * I Eta Pi, created by Rachel Zissel and friends there was a flyer in the Aggie dispenser outside of Social Sciences 1100 for the longest time.
 * ["Rho Omicron Omicron Rho"] - POOP
 * ["IDB" Iota Delta Beta]
 * Beta Epsilon Sigma Tau
 * Phelta Thi, (although its letters aren't strictly greek) sighted in Tercero K Building 2001-2002
 * Thelta Omegacron Pfi (whose rush flyer advertised "Free Beer!").
 * ["Kappa Epsilon Gamma"] (K.E.G.)

and a sorority that nobody would ever care to join Phi Alpha Tau!
