Flyering is one of the many forms of ["Free Community Advertising"] that Davis Wiki and other groups use. While not entirely free, flyers are pretty cheap to make and free to post.

== First Flyer ==
["PhilipNeustrom"] made the first Wiki Flyer (08/4/04), and it looks like this:

''I plan to pass it out to friends and people that look like they might be interested.  I might leave some at ["Cafe Roma"].'' - ["PhilipNeustrom"]

And now, check out this awesome ASCII flyer:

''I <3 oldskool'' - ["MarieHuynh"]
  * Me too.  I have a bunch of them printed out and I gave them to ["PaulIvanov"] to put up around ["Kemper Hall"] and so forth -- but he never put even a single one up.  So much for him, eh.  Maybe I should print more and do it myself. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]


== First efforts ==
The plan (a while ago):
 Soon we will be going public, and this entails some publicity and advertisement.  We will, of course, need to be careful at first as to where we advertise.  It would be much better to build the site slowly than have it rapidly explode.  However, a lot of energy can build if we have a good base to start off with (growth is VERY good!)  Advertisement in the right places would be a good idea (at first) -- but generally the WikiWay will take care of growth problems.

Below is a list of places that ["LUGOD"] posts flyers.  Lets copy them and also post flyers there. ('''Once we go public''')

  * ["Tapioca Express"]
      EStreet, between 1st and 2nd
      Ask manager for 'okay.' Place a stack of flyers.

  * ["Borders"]
      1st Street
      Get ok from staff. They'll review and post on the bulletin board (near the restrooms) at their discretion.

  * ["Jamba Juice"]
      1st Street, near Borders Books
      Get ok from staff. They typically post one copy on the wall.

  * ["Ben & Jerry's"]
      1st Street, near Borders Books
      (Better if related to privacy/freedom/etc.) Get ok from staff. Post on bulletin board.

  * Heron Computing
      E St. Across from Great Wall, Crepe Bistro, etc.
      Talk to staff. They'll place a stack somewhere.

  * ["Tower Records"]
      F St. Across from Great Wall, Crepe Bistro, etc.
      Talk to staff. Tape one up in the window by the check-out counter, facing outward.

  * ["Armadillo Music"]
      F St. Across from Tower Music.
      Talk to staff. They usually stick one up in the window or on one of the bulletin boards.

  * ["The Co-Op"]
      G St, near 8th.
      Post one or two copies on the bulletin board outside.

  * Sweet Briar Books
      G Street, near the Davis Food Co-Op.
      Talk to staff. Tape one on the front of the check-out counter.

  * ["Bogey's Books"]
      E Street. Across from Great Wall, Crepe Bistro, etc.
      Post one on the bulletin board near the entrance.

["North Davis"]

  * Jamba Juice
      Covell near ["Highway 113"]. Near Safeway.
      Get ok from staff. Post one up on bulletin board, or place stack next to bulletin board.

["South Davis"]

  * Bus Stops on Richards
      Between Wendy's/KFC and Safeway
      These stops are VERY crowded!
== Flyers from early Fall ==
Idea for the early fall flyers:
 A new flyer should be made.  It should be well designed and stand out.  The first flyer was tiny and designed to be only kind of noticed.  It also had a lot of text.  ["MikeIvanov"] should post the postscript version of the logo so that work can be done on a new flyer.  Also, "flyer" can be taken to mean "larger piece of paper put in places like ["Wellman Hall"].  Maybe we ought to have smaller flyers to hand out and larger ones to post around.

=== 2/3 of the early fall flyers ===

These above two have been posted around (on 10-27-04)

(["MikeIvanov"] needs to upload the other one)

= Newest flyers =

Please crop the flyers neatly before posting or distributing.

''The 'OMG', 'WTF' flyers are based on Judson Wickham's original idea.''

 * Here is a full-page PDF of the logo [http://www.daviswiki.org/logo.pdf] and also the same thing in Flash [http://www.daviswiki.org/logo.swf].  Feel free to make your own flyers, just post them here first so you can get some feedback.
[[Comments]]
------
''2004-11-30 01:50:08'' [[nbsp]] I like the second OMG better, "Davis resource done right" just rings Engrish to me. - ["TravisGrathwell"]------
''2004-11-30 03:03:48'' [[nbsp]] Yeah, that one was a shitty tag line I came up with when I threw together the OMG design.  It's based on Jud's idea. - ["MikeIvanov"]------
''2004-11-30 03:06:30'' [[nbsp]] I really like the second one.  I think we ought to flyer around on Wednesday methink, regardless of what flyer we decide on. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
------
''2004-11-30 07:58:53'' [[nbsp]] I love it.   - ["JaimeRaba"]------
''2004-11-30 18:56:40'' [[nbsp]] MG? i don't get it - ["ArlenAbraham"]------
''2004-11-30 18:56:50'' [[nbsp]] crap, wait... - ["ArlenAbraham"]------
''2004-11-30 20:59:28'' [[nbsp]] I like the "who do you have to blow" one.  It's just... artful and offensive. - ["JaimeRaba"]------
''2004-11-30 21:00:05'' [[nbsp]] the only problem is that does anyone remember Davis411?  It's was pretty much dying and languishing to the point of nobody noticing it. - ["JaimeRaba"]------
''2004-11-30 21:06:38'' [[nbsp]] I hear people talk about Davis411 once in a while.  A bunch of sites still link to them. - ["MikeIvanov"]------
''2004-11-30 21:09:49'' [[nbsp]] Yeah, like Daviscoeds.com heh.  But I don't think it's universal enough to resound with the less techie.  People who knew about Davis411 probably know about Daviswiki.  ( : - ["JaimeRaba"]------
''2004-12-01 00:50:07'' [[nbsp]] The second OMG and the WTF ones a great! - ["JackHaskel"]------
''2004-12-01 01:08:37'' [[nbsp]] I like the second of the OMG ones, but I really like the one that pokes fun at Davis411.  Do you have to talk to people on campus to let you post? - ["RohiniJasavala"]------
''2004-12-01 10:00:03'' [[nbsp]] Thanks for all the responses, keep them coming.  So far we haven't talked to anyone on campus before posting, but we've only done a couple of flyers. - ["MikeIvanov"]------
''2004-12-01 10:21:12'' [[nbsp]] No need to talk to anyone before you post unless the bulliten board specifically says you have to.  - ["JackHaskel"]------
''2004-12-01 10:28:58'' [[nbsp]] Great.  Does anyone think the WTF one is ''too'' offensive to post on campus? - ["MikeIvanov"]------
''2004-12-01 10:32:34'' [[nbsp]] I don't think WTF is too offensive. I think it is just out there enough that people will really notice and the site will stick in their heads.  I haven't seen many people who know of this site, since people were asking what I was taking pictures for. - ["RohiniJasavala"]
------
''2004-12-01 10:48:01'' [[nbsp]] I don't think it's too offensive either. It might possibly offend a few people but that's ok. TV is much more offensive. Plus, it'll really capture people's attention.  - ["JackHaskel"]
------
''2004-12-02 09:23:58'' [[nbsp]] We should make the WTF and OMG ones ready for printing. Once I have something to print, I'll start posting some in my free time. - ["JackHaskel"]
------
''2004-12-03 02:34:40'' [[nbsp]] OMGWTFBBQ! - ["MarieHuynh"]------
''2004-12-03 17:43:13'' [[nbsp]] I posted some flyers today in Olson, the MU and Wellman.  - ["JackHaskel"]------
''2004-12-04 17:31:41'' [[nbsp]] Awesome, ["JackHaskel" Jack]!  I saw them in Wellman on Friday night!  I'm going to flyer tonight and tomorrow (and possibly very early monday morning).  As for chalking, I'd be interesting in making a stencil type thing if it were possible -- but my concern is how ''legal'' is chalking on campus (especially for non-["SPAC"] groups?) - ["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2004-12-05 09:37:48'' [[nbsp]] I seem to remember hearing that chalking is never actually allowed. I think that it'd be fine to chalk though.  - ["JackHaskel"]------
''2004-12-06 10:16:13'' [[nbsp]] As far as chalking goes, it's easy to silk screen (I think you can do this in ["Walker Hall"]) cool designs like ["SOS"] does. Also, I love the black OMG flyers. - ["ArlenAbraham"]
------
''2004-12-14 23:06:22'' [[nbsp]] Anyone want to go ["Student Focus"] style and campaign (flyer) in the dorms with me? - ["ArlenAbraham"]
------
''2005-01-24 19:11:16'' [[nbsp]] Arlen, I'll go flyering in the dorms for sure! Someone talented should make up another flyer that can be easily printed up real small so we can hand it out. I also want them to hand to people in the MU, near computer labs and people on laptops. --["JackHaskel"]------
''2005-01-24 21:51:00'' [[nbsp]] A new kick-ass update of the wiki software is coming very soon, and we'll have some new flyers when we roll that out.  So it would be great if you guys could hold off a few days! --["MikeIvanov"]------
''2005-01-24 23:57:17'' [[nbsp]] Sounds good! --["JackHaskel"]
