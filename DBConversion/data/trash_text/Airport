The UC Davis Airport started in 1950 and is now under regulation of ["Transportation And Parking Services" TAPS].  It works as a place for the UC's research fields and argricultural endeavours as well as a place for UC employee transportation.

=Fun Note=

At night, one can walk down Olive Tree Lane (off Russell) to a road that is just behind the runway.  You can watch planes land over your head there - it's a thrill.

Never ever park your car near the airport runway and study....espically if you look like me (Indian). I was just chilling there one afternoon, studying for ENL 104B and this police officer comes racing to my car. He told me that the airport reported me as being suspiciously close to the runway. Also he told me that I “shouldn’t be studying here.” It was kinda scary because I noticed that all ground traffic at the airport was stopped because of me. So the moral of the story is...don’t “chill” near the airport just for kicks or otherwise the airport people will flip out and call the cops. I’m not trying to imply that the cops got me because I’m Indian, but I guess it really didn’t help my case just to be chillin’.

''2004-12-22 11:48:23'' [[nbsp]] Although, the cops don't really have much of a right to hassle you here (not as far as I know of anyway). In fact, many airports actually have a designated parking lot/park area where people can sit and watch the planes. I think someone was just being a bit of a prick (not really the cop, who was probably just doing his job, but the jerk who called to report you). Seriously. What sort of "terrorist" is just waiting to mess w/ the UCD campus airport? - ["EricKlein"]

''2004-12-23 14:53:23'' [[nbsp]] well according to the data I pulled out of my rear end, UC Davis International Airport is the central hub for all Pacific Rim air-traffic. We get shipments of drugs from South America and cute little plastic things from Asia. Hold on to your hats when the 747-400 direct from Taipei comes rolling in there every day at 3 PM. 
But yea, seriously, i totally second your point on that......the airport at Davis is far too small for anyone to care about. You could easily live in the city of Davis for 30 years and not know that it had an airfield.  --["GeorgejAndrews"]
