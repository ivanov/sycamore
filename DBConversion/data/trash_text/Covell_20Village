In mid-2004, a group of local developers proposed to convert a ~400 acre plot north of ["Covell" Covell Blvd.], between ["Pole Line Rd."] and ["F St."], from farmland into residential and commercial sites. This would include approximately 1500 living units, a school, a shopping center across from the current ["Nugget"] center, a fire station, and park areas.

Supporters of the project claim that it would alleviate the dearth of available housing and help nearby businesses. Opponents claim that the new homes would be priced prohibitively high and that the local infrastructure would be unable to support the rapid development plan.

According to recently released documents, Covell Village will be the nation's most innovative solar neighborhood. Three decades ago, when Mike Corbett built Village Homes, he put Davis on the map as an alternative energy leader. Now he has designed the nation's most innovative solar neighborhood, Covell Village. In Covell Village, rooftop solar panels will supply single-family homes with clean, reliable electricity.  A farmland buffer will border the neightborhood's 60-acres of wildlife habitat, eight miles of bike paths, and 40 acres of parks and greenbelts. A village center will offer dining and shopping. And most of the neighborhood will be smaller homes that middle-income Davis families can afford.
