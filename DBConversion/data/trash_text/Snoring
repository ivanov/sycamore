Be careful of snoring in Davis.

In 1994, a woman was cited for violating Davis' infamous noise ordinance because she was snoring in her own bed, in her own apartment, and the noise bothered her neighbor, who called the police.

The incident brought the national news media to Davis.  One enterprising camera crew even set up shop in the complainant's apartment, hoping to catch the sound of his neighbor snoring.

The city ultimately decided not to pursue the case, the woman sued for damages and the case settled out of court.

''2004-12-12 23:19:19'' [[nbsp]] Snoring is still much a problem in Davis, especially for the residents of 2020 Cowell, #215 in Tanglewood.  This is due to the sleeping habits of the respectful (yet loud, when it comes to sleeping) residents of the apartment below. - ["AbbyLawson"]
