There are three Taco Bells in Davis. One is downtown on 425 G St, across from the Signature Theatres Stadium 5 movie theater. The second is near the Mace Blvd freeway ramps, at 4811 Chiles Rd.  The third is in ["The Silo"].

The downtown 'Bell does not have a drive through but does have good parking and generally better service.
