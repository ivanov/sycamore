= Overview =
Sword and Sandals is a registered campus interest group that has existed on campus since 1921.  While the organization is no longer a secret society, it was for most of its history.  The membership of Sword and Sandals is made up of many undergraduate students, various graduate students, as well as alumni.  Because members are selected based upon their leadership abilities, many of the University elite are or once were members -- e.g. Past Chancellors, high-ranking members of ["ASUCD"], as well heads of other campus organizations.  Sword and Sandals meets every so often on campus to discuss topics relevant to the University.  The organization never takes action, does not vote on issues, but rather serves as a ground for frank and open discussion.  The membership is encouraged to come learn about and debate issues, and to use the information they hear at meetings as they see fit in their everyday lives.

Much like the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones Skull and Bones] at Yale University, the Sword and Sandals keeps the proceedings of its meetings secret and is used by members to interact and discuss issues.  Several exposes published in the ["The California Aggie"] (the last was in 1993), as well as this wiki page, have diminished the secrecy of the organization. The group still exists today, but the effectiveness of the organization has been questioned.

On Saturday, January 29th, Sword and Sandals held their yearly Winter Banquet on campus in the MUII.  While many of us left our cameras at home, we were lucky enough to have some Davis Wiki users come to photograph through the windows of this "secret event."  P.S. Since I am sure you are going to erase this anyways...Did you guys actually steal the bags of dirt or did you put them back?  We are having trouble finding them.  Thanks.  -- <3 Kalen
  * ''Hey Kalen, thanks for posting.  We did not mean to steal the bags of dirt but instead forgot to put them back (after Brian McInnis told Paul to leave we sort of scurried off).  I will gladly give them back to you.  I understand you think this is silly, but I (along with others) feel it's important to know about.  While I don't consider it a 'secret society' (I changed the text up there just now) -- it was for most of its history.  The organization has created much controversy and mystery, and I just wanted to see what it was up to these days.  Regardless, members of the general public are not invited to these meetings and the membership consists of the strongest campus leaders -- essentially, powerful people meeting behind closed doors to discuss issues.  This can be considered a good thing:  People like yourself get a chance to talk to folks you wouldn't ordinarly get a chance to talk with.  But it can also be seen as negative due to the high-ranking membership and lack of public interaction.  Whether or not someone thinks it's bad, the last time the Aggie covered the organization was in 93'.  My interest wasn't in 'exposing' the organization but rather just finding out the kind of things they do and the people involved.  Anyway, peace.  --["PhilipNeustrom"]''

--Ya no problem big guy.  I totally see where you are coming from.  If you want to sit down and talk about it sometime just let me know.  We could do an 'interview' or something if you like.  I think that might clear up some of the misconceptions.  Also if I could get the bags of dirt back if possible, that would be great.  Just hit me up (AIM = kalengallagher, email = kcgallagher@ucdavis.edu, phone = 408-761-2361) and we can talk.  Peace.

Here is their Ground Breaking Report:

= Before the meeting began =

''The following photographs and text is taken from a purely outsiders standpoint, as the photographers never entered the meeting.''

The organization reserved ["MU II"], ["Smith Room"], ["Garrison Room"], and the ["Fielder Room"].  The main meeting took place in ["MU II"], and the other rooms were used for catering or smaller meetings.

While ["MU II"] is hardly secluded, this was, after all, a Saturday night -- practically no one was on ["Campus"] and the likelihood of someone stumbling by the meeting while it was in progress was minimal.  Of particular note is how well dressed everyone was.  The student members were wearing suits or nice dress clothes.  The ["ASUCD"] officials were dressed much better than they usually are for ["Senate"] meetings.

= The meeting =
[[Thumbnail(IMG_003_4.jpg,right,"Folks gather around and chat before everybody's shown up.")]]
The bulk of the meeting seemed to consist of gathering around tables and talking.  ["Kalen Gallagher"] (["ASUCD President"], ["Student Focus"]) was one of the first students to show up.  There was a small podium set up, along with a laptop connected to a projector. [[Thumbnail(IMG_1245.jpg,"Several unidentified individuals can be seen, as well as the laptop and projector")]]  [[Thumbnail(IMG_1270.jpg,"Everyone chatting and dining.  ["Kalen Gallagher"], Chris Ryan (["Sigma Phi Epsilon"]), as well as others can be seen.")]]

== The Garrison Room ==
[[Thumbnail(IMG_1142.jpg,right,"A document is read aloud to three unknown individuals.")]]

Perhaps the most mysterious of events unfolded in the ["Garrison Room"], adjacent to ["MU II"].  ["Kalen Gallagher"] and a number of other unidentified individuals headed into the room after the meeting in the main room had began.  First the lights appeared to be on, then they turned off and strange music was heard from within the room (''note:  not sure if the music was coming from the main room or this room in particular'').  Afterward the photo to the right was taken.

[[Thumbnail(IMG_0245.jpg,"Items left in the Garrison Room.")]]

After leaving the ["Garrison Room"], a number of items were left behind.  Three brown bags, three packets of soil, and a number of candies and coins were left there.  The bags looked to be originally taped together, and it is likely the items came from the bags. 

It is possible that the reading that took place, the music, and the brown bags filled with strange items was some sort of ritual.  After all, there were three people sitting in front of the bags in the first ["Garrison Room"] photograph (above right).

[[Thumbnail(IMG_1169.jpg,left,"A close-up of the soil found in the Garrison room.")]]

== A room gone dark ==
[[Thumbnail(IMG_0243.jpg,right,"A dark room with faint candles visible (click to see).")]]

Suddenly, after the meeting in the main room had been underway for a while, the lights went off.  It was then noticed that ''candles were lit''!  The room stayed candle-lit for 10-15 minutes.  The candles, along with the mystery of the Garrison Room, helped reinforce that while this organization has lost much of its secrecy in recent years, it is still filled with tradition and is alive to this very day.

[[Thumbnail(IMG_0244.jpg,"A closer view of the candles.")]]

After the lights came back on, their meeting proceeded as before -- much chatting, and socializing. At this point one of our photographers was then asked by a member (who was on his cell phone outside at the time) ''"What are you taking pictures of?"''  This, along with the general lack of activity inside the meeting and the fact the photographers had prior commitments caused us to take off at this point.
