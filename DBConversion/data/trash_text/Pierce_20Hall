Pierce Hall is a part of ["Tercero"], consisting of buildings G - M with the exception of I (interesting note: I was not included as a building name because on mailings the letters L and I look similar and the university didn't want to deal with any mixups). It is adjacent to Thille Hall; in fact, many don't even realize then they are in either one.
