= Bathrooms in Davis =

Of the different establishments here in Davis, a such simple item as a bathroom can make or break
a given establishment.  A place to go pinch one can make a difference of opinion of where, um, you do
business at.

== UC Davis ==

 * ["Cleanest Bathrooms"] at ["Campus" UC Davis]

== Resturaunts ==

 * ["Chipotle"] has nice bathrooms and they are generally cool about letting you use them.

== Bars ==

Bar bathrooms can be known for being cool but also they can be known as "hole in the wall".

== Stores ==

Bathrooms to use while shopping. This can include requirements to buy an item from an establishment before going to excrete.

== Cool Bathrooms ==

Unusual bathroooms including fancy and/or unusual decor, strange toilets such as the English style water closet.

 * ["Delta of Venus"] has the coolest toilet seat in ["Yolo County"], if not the world.

== Bathrooms from Hell ! ==

Bathrooms you want to avoid like the plauge such as nasty smells, not kept clean, lack of privacy when going number two, etc.

 * ["South Silo Bathroom" EVIL HAUNTED SOUTH SILO BATHROOM] beside the ["Craft Center"] ''There are holes in the walls of the mens room stalls so you can look into them!'' - ["TheRadish"] (lifted from ["Cleanest Bathrooms"] )

== Unisex Bathrooms? ==
If you are concerned about clean bathrooms, maybe you're interested in bathrooms that are accessible to differently-abled persons and gender-variant people as well?  The Trans-Action Committee on campus at UCD is presently looking specifically for data on unisex bathrooms, both on and off campus.  Anybody have this info?  Please be in touch: mproebstel(at)ucd - thanks.
