[http://www.primerogrove.com/ Primero Grove] are apartments on campus, open to the general student population to live in. You need to camp out overnight in February or March, and they don't get back to you to let you know whether you're in until June. The best way to get to live there is thus to know somebody and inherit an existing lease.

Primero Grove is managed by [http://www.eahhousing.org/ EAH, Inc.]

About half of Primero Grove is currently rented out to the Student Housing office as ["Dorms"].

There are four buildings in Primero Grove.
    * ["Laurel"]
    * ["Magnolia"]
    * ["Manzanita"]
    * ["Spruce"]
