During the long days of summer, the sun beats down with a vengeance.  Day after day of hot, dry weather keeps people indoors, in the safety of their air conditioners.  When it seems like nothing could break the monotony of Summer Davis ["Weather"], a cool, humid breeze starts to filter in and life becomes bearable outside.

The Delta Breeze is the local name for a wind coming from the southwest, off of ["The Delta"] of the ["Sacramento River"] and San Joaquin River.  This wind carries with it cooler, more humid air from off of the Pacific Ocean.  The effects of this wind are very noticable during the summer, as this seabreeze can cool the air by more than 10^o^F (that's 90/5^o^ C!).  This can turn an unbearable summer day to a comfortable one, especially for those of us from cooler climates.
