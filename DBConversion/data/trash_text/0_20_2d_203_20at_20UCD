This is an alcohol awareness campaign by the Campus Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Program (CADAPP).  According to a study conducted by the ["Cowell Student Health Center"] in 2000, most Aggies have zero to three drinks when they "party."  Another campaign, or maybe the same one, by CADAPP featured the slogan "Don't be a Dick."

The program advertises that 71% of students have only 0-3 drinks when they party, as some form of statistical peer pressure.  However, this also means that over 6,000 students have more than 3 drinks when they party, meaning that you're in a pretty sizable minority when you get smashed.
