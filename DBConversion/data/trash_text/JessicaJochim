JessicaJochim is very neat and clean and is often disappointed in her messy roommate ["KatieWillheim"].  She has an affinity for purses and firemen.  She once had a dog for ten days that she washed thoughly.  She took it to the vet.  She took it on walks.  She even put her socks on the dog's feet and kept them up with ribbon - so pretty.  Then its owner came and Jessica lost her dog.  Jessica does own a rabbit named ["PierrelaLapin"] who is cute and sometimes a little neglected but loved nonetheless.
