CHEAT is a currently fictional ["Slate" slate] running for ["ASUCD"] ["Senate"].  CHEAT, like many ["LEAD" other] ["FUCK" slates], is an acronym for more words likely to impress voters: Citizens Helping Energize Aggie Thought.  While it does not currently have any candidates, it has gained momentum in 2004-2005 due to the ["Campaigning in Dorms Controversy"].  As it's been said at Senate many times by people like ["Paloma Perez"] and ["Nafeh Malik"], many people around the table have cheated in the past by campaiging in the dorms.  It is also rumored that one or both of ["LEAD"] and ["Student Focus" Focus] spend more than is allowed for their glossy flyers.  So why not CHEAT right out in the open?  Vote CHEAT!
