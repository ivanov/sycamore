=Students for an Orwellian Student Senate Slate=
(or something like that)

The slate recommended voting:

#1 ["JonathonLeathers"][[BR]]
#2 ["ChadVanSchoelandt"][[BR]]
#3 ["MarieHuynh"][[BR]]
#4 ["ChrisRood"][[BR]]

They had planned to change the name of the ["Death Star"] to be officially called the Death Star and ["Kleiber Hall"] to ["Keebler Hall"] since that is what many students call it anyway.  They wanted to paint a GIANT elf on the side of Keebler Hall and possibly get doubleplusmoney from the cookie people.

 ''You would probably have to pay George Lucas to use the name "Death Star" officially.'' - ["KenjiYamada"][[BR]]
  ''It actually sounds like free publicity for the franchise to me.'' - ["BrentLaabs"][[BR]]
  ''Lucas isn't big on free publicity. Or logic. You'll probably have to pay.'' - ["EricKlein"]

Their Plans to deal with ["Lamargate"]:
 On a more serious note, the IRS is coming after UCD(no thanks to the idiots that broke the law in our name) so we would like to cut unnecessary things(ie $5000 for a fire truck to shoot tube socks at people, trip to mountains for senate members,etc.) and at the same time show support for groups on campus that help the community.  

If elected to ["Senate"], the slate promised to donate half of our senate paycheck to local charities/clubs/whatever that need the money.

Their official mascot is ["Yev"], also nicknamed "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkers_speech Checkers]".  3 of the 4 members of the slate are associated with ["Students for an Orwellian Society"].

In Fall of 2004, none of the candidates were elected, though #1 candidate Jonathon Leathers was only eliminated in the last round, short [https://elections.ucdavis.edu/resultsf04/Fall%202004%20Round17.htm 42 votes].  The Orwellian slate takes this as a mandate for change, despite the fact that they actually lost. They received so many votes without getting caught cheatng that they have said, "We have political capital, and we intend to spend it." Another acheivemnet is that ["ChadVanSchoelandt"] received more #20 votes than any other candidate. They are planning on running in the next election.

''It looks like the SOSSS fliers that advocated voting 1. Jonathon Leathers 2. Chad Van Schoelandt 3. Marie Huynh 4. Christopher Rood weren't such a great idea, as they resulted in the latter three getting so few first-choice votes that they were [https://elections.ucdavis.edu/resultsf04/Fall%202004%20Round.htm eliminated in the first two rounds]. STV is known to reward candidates with stronger core support (read: first-choice votes). A strategy you might try next quarter is something like "If your birthday is between such and such a date, vote in this order, etc." Of course, if you spaced each of the 24 possible orders equally across the calendar year, you risk the possibility that SOSSS's support will be so diluted that ''none'' of the candidates will be elected. So play around with it a bit and strike a balance.

And remember that especially for few-winner elections like this, STV isn't especially proportional... about 1/7 of the votes will be "wasted" (N.B. this figure is only true for our specific elections, with six seat using Droop quota) . This can even happen in larger parliaments; in the 1998 Northern Ireland elections, UUP won more seats than SDLP, despite getting less of the vote.'' - ["RaghavKrishnapriyan"]
 * You are a fool if you think that we didn't do any research on this.  The point of the slate was not to get all of us in.  We were trying to get the most qualified of us in by concentrating the votes on one person.  The rest of us were merely support.  In fact, we told people NOT to vote for the rest of us as #1 but some did so anyway.  Things went more or less according to plan and Jonathan was the last person to be eliminated.  Sure, we ended up not getting anyone in.  But what do you expect when other people cheat? - ["MarieHuynh"]
Well, it's an interesting problem, anyway (though I'm not sure what you mean by "support"). It would probably work better if we had "above-the-line voting", as Australian Senate elections do. 95% of Australian voters vote above the line, after all. Are you going to be running anyone for President? - ["RaghavKrishnapriyan"]

Okay, and the ballot data is [http://ucdgreens.org/ballotdata/ available now] (thank you, Greens) and even if we eliminated the candidates accused of campaigning (Haag, Malik and Ruel) their replacements would be Manteghi, Prodigalidad and Chin (Leathers is still eliminated in the last round). I heard that Malik told students to vote for anyone in a yellow shirt though, which would taint the rest of the election results. Sucks. :-/ -["RaghavKrishnapriyan"]

But it should be noted that there was a fourth accused Focus member: Derrick Prodigalidad. When the results were run with the current four accused removed, it gave the 3 seats to Manteghi, Chin , and Leathers from SOSSS. - ["RevChad"]
