The Genome Center just opened in Fall of 2004 as an addition to the ["Health Sciences District"].  

It is a six story building designed to bring various labs across campus together into one building. There are more and more labs moving in each day into the Center.  This center was designed to be a central environment for genomics on campus.

The Director of the Facility is Richard M. Michelmore.
