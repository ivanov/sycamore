This sign lies right across from the sign for the ["Mathematical Sciences Building"], next to a bunch of temporary-looking buildings. Maybe they're going to bulldoze the temporary buildings to make this stuff. It really doesn't look like there's enough space though. The timetable as noted on the sign is so far from now (2004) that nobody running the show at UCD's probably thought it through yet either. The answers to these perplexing questions of building location, like many answers to life, probably lie deep within the [http://www.ae.ucdavis.edu/ UC Davis Architects and Engineers] website.
