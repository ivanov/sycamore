Kristy Heidenberger is an undergraduate at UC Davis majoring in communication and Italian.

She likes kitties, [http://files.livejournal.com/emosnail/phonepost/837.ogg squirrels] and the colour pink.  In fact she works at a kitty warehouse on campus, where she is what you might call a "[http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v59/PinkPassion/Davis/?action=view&current=kristy-smokeykins2.jpg kitty technician]."  The so-called "C-Barn" keeps and raises cats for nutritional studies.

Kristy is from Pleasanton in the bay area.  This is not the town superman is from, and it is not the location of the movie Pleasantville, though I do recommend watching that movie.

In a recent poll on the ["EMOSNAIL" emosnail] livejournal, Kristy was voted to have "[http://photobucket.com/albums/v16/snail_tyrant/Photo%20Essays/Kristy%20Visits/?action=view&current=asapvt47.jpg breathtaking beauty]."

Also she has a lot of sass.  In fact we say she is "sass in a glass."  For unknown reasons, she is dating local curmudgeon ["KrisFricke" Kris Fricke].

She also has a livejournal you should check out [http://www.livejournal.com/users/basicallyasap/ basically asap].
