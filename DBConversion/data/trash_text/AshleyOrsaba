4th year civil engineering student. Engineering intern for the City of Davis during the school year and Summers Engineering during breaks. By breaks I mean school breaks, since I work FULL TIME during all school breaks, so breaks are just in fact WORK. Ick.

Ashley Update: Fresh powder means I am in Tahoe this weekend. Hell yeah!

Sits most nights at desk doing pages of endless engineering homework and daydreams of snowboarding in fresh powder........... sigh
