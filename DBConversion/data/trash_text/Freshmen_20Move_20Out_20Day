The days leading up to and after the last day of school ["Freshmen"] are forced out of the dorms and in to the streets. On this occasion, tons of waste is created. Stupid ["Sorority Girls"] and ["Bros"] tend to throw out lots of stuff so that they don't have to bring it home or put it in storage. 

Laudably, ["R4 Recycling"] organizes a ["Resource Recovery Drive"] which designates areas that these "resources" are to be put. There is always at least one location for every dorm complex. Simply go by those zones and rummage through for tons of great stuff. Everything left is later put up for sale at their ["Resource Recovery Exchange"] for ridiculously cheap prices. 

 * One year I got six carpets. - ["JackHaskel"]
 * I got to fill my car up with Freshmen goodness! Later in the Year R4 sells their stuff at a small fee.  I got 9 shirts for $4.50, some were even new shirts with the tags on. - ["RohiniJasavala"]
