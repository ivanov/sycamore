The Hotdogger is a little sweet spot in ["Downtown"].  It's a tiny little place, but there's some seating outside if you wish to eat your dog there.  They serve up a wide range of different types of hot dogs (including vegeterian options), wrapped in absolutely delicious buns.  They've got about 6 different types of mustard alone, and that should tell you something about the quality and precision of this operation.  They are friendly there and also operate a small hot dog stand near campus sometimes.  They also always have a place set up at ["Picnic In The Park"].  

["The California Aggie"] also ran [http://californiaaggie.com/article/?id=142 a story] on the Hot Dogger, which makes it seem that the Hot Dogger's management dislikes the growth of the University.

The owners, Ivan and Cheryl, now operate ["Froggy's" The Pond at Froggy's], the restaurant replacing Mike's Grill at Froggy's.
