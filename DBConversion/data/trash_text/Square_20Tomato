In the early 1950s California's tomato industry was threatened because of the lack of laborers to harvest the crops. In response, the UC Davis agricultural engineering department developed the mechanical tomato harvester. Unfortunately, this machine crushed the tomatoes. The vegetable crops department came to the rescue by genetically engineering a firmer-skinned tomato-also known as the square tomato-that the machine could not crush, thus keeping kept California's tomato industry alive.

Ironically, a "square tomato" is not square.  It is a type of tomato that was bred at UC Davis to ship better and pack into boxes without losses (i.e., ripped or smashed tomatos).  Most of the tomatos you find in the supermarket are square tomatos.

''Well, yes this is true, however, most of the tomatoes you find in the store are processed. The square tomato, as well as the tomato harvester, were developed for the processing tomato industry. Processing tomatos are harvested by big scary machines, dumped into those white bins you see trucks pulling, and trucked off to the nearest processing plant. In the plant, processing tomatoes become everything you ever dreamed they could be except fresh market tomatoes.'' -- ["ArlenAbraham" aa]

''I'm unsure it was a University related project.  There are plenty of ag-business places in town.  I do know it was Davis... details, anybody?" -- ["JabberWokky"]''

''"The firm-skinned square tomato was developed by UC Davis' department of Vegetable Crops sometime in the 1950s in response to our earlier development by Ag Engineering of the mechanical tomato harvester. Actual inventor of the square tomato was Gordie C. Hanna, Associate in the Agricultural Experiment Station and Professor in Truck Crops, University of California, Davis (1938-1967)" --AlphaDog''
