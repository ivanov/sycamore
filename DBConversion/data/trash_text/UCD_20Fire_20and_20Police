'''''752-1230''' would be a ''very'' good number for cell phone users to progam into their phones. Also '''758-3600''' for non-campus emergencies. When you dial 911 from a cell phone, you are connected with a CHP dispatcher who generaly has no idea what's going on. It will significantly reduce the emergency response time if you call dispatch directly.'' - ["ArlenAbraham" aa]
