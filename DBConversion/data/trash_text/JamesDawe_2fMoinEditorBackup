= Political Characterizations of Davis =
== Progressive ==
Like most college towns and campuses, Davis is a thriving “bastion” of liberal thought and practice. Although not as overt as ["UC Berkeley" Berkeley], Davis carries the progressive torch in more practical and subtle ways: ["Bicycles"], ["Unitrans" Hydrogen and Natural Gas Buses], Environmental Research, and ["The Co-Op" Organic Living]. Additionally, under the past administration of a “hippie” mayor, it is said that fruit trees were planted in open lots in the city in order to feed the homeless. Every year the ["Whole Earth Festival"] is also celebrated on Mother’s Day weekend... a self-proclaimed testament to alternative living, foods, music, and politics. Also see ["People's Republic of Davis"].

==Moderate==

  ''(A lot can be said here about the political dynamics in Davis and the relative strengths and distinctions between "progressive," "moderate," and "conservative" forces.  For instance, there is a so-called "developer democrat" power structure that serves as a machine to bring people up from the school board, to the city council, to the county board of supervisors, and eventually on to the State Assembly and State Senate.  Most importantly, there is a distinction between true progressiveness and a predominant veneer of progressiveness that I hope will be respected in this page as it develops. -cj ) '' 

== Conservative ==
Although progressive as previously stated, Davis remains fundamentally conservative in many ways due to its middle America farmtown nature. There exist few "hillbillies" (mostly reserved for ["Woodland"]/["Dixon"]) but the occasional one can be spotted in town. Additionally Davis is very much a middle class suburb, home to professionals from ["Sacramento"] and other surrounding cities. Therefore, as any respectable suburb would have it, parties are routinely broken up from cranky neighbors and residents who hold a slight disdain for those darn troublesome students. 

The honor guard of conservative politics is ["Davis College Republicans"], who make some pretty daredevil political statements that '''everyone''' notices. Judging from the was politics generally runs in Davis (outside of an election year), ["Davis College Democrats"] may well also be considered conservative for Davis. ''(My freshman year, there really was no place for Davis College Democrats in campus politics, and so they didn't really exist -- ["KenBloom"]''

= Representatives =
== City Officials ==
The [http://www.city.davis.ca.us/meetings/agenda.cfm?c=18 Davis City Council] has 5 members.  They are elected at-large, 2 and 3 at a time in the primary election of even-numbered years.  Terms are four years.

The mayor is selected internally by the council.  Traditionally, the top vote-getter at the most recent election is chosen.  The person chosen then serves two years as Mayor Pro-tem and then two years as Mayor.  Mayors in Davis do not have additional power, but they run the city council meetings and serve a ceremonial role at community events.

The City of Davis has about 25 [http://www.city.davis.ca.us/meetings/ task forces, commissions, and committees] that are open to varying degrees of public involvement.  Many of these can be applied for, and then the City Council selects the members.  For important commissions, the members to be chosen can be "invited to apply" rather than being invited after applying.
