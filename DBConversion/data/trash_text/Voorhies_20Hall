Voorhies Hall houses the [http://www.english.ucdavis.edu English] department. Fondly called "Voorhideous" by some of its inhabitants, it also houses the University Writing Program (the purveyors of the English Comp requirement), the Humanities department, the Medieval Studies department, and a few others. This is one of the buildings on campus that is primarily offices, not classrooms.

The Voorhies courtyard is a rose garden, with a giant tree and some benches. Not to mention the nice (though constantly leaking) fountain.
