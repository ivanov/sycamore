Agnostic and Atheist Student Association (2001-??)

A response to what was at the time, very aggressive and deceptive marketing on the part of some of the Christian organizations on campus - this fractured group was founded by three people, all of whom have now moved out of Davis and on to other things.  One member is rumored to now be imprisoned.  Although the mailing list address thesoapbox@ucdavis.edu  is still active with members, there has not been a meeting since 2002 or so.  The group as such can probably be considered disbanned.


The group's nominal president is ["KrisFricke"] though at the slightest show of interest on anyone else's part he tries to shleff the title off on them.  Every quarter Kris aspires to restart the club and it keeps not happening.  In 2002-2003 there were actually several serious attempts at restarting it but low turnouts at the time has lead to Kris' future lack of optimism.  Now no longer registered with ["SPAC"], the $65 in the treasure has been disgorged to Kris.  He now feels he has a moral obligation to have a meeting and spend the money on the club.  He is slightly more optimistic than usual that it might actually do something this upcoming quarter (Winter 2005).

It is strongly encouraged that if you are interested you harass Kris about having a meeting by emailing him at krfricke@ucdavis.edu

'maybe I should do something...' - ["MarieHuynh"]
[[BR]]I tried emailing Kris, but haven't heard anything back from him.  Maybe we should take that last sentence out? - ["LizaAbeja"][[BR]]
''my internet has been down for the last two days.  On any account its been barely over 24 hours since you emailed me hasn't it?  I've been meaning to get back to you as soon as I catch up on my email though, sorry about the delay.'' -["KrisFricke"]
