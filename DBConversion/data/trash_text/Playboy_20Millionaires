As self-proclaimed rivals of ["ChoadBot"], the Playboy Millionaires bring the the fog machine to the scene. Guitarist/vocalist ["JoeFinkel"] stomps his boots while drummer ["JaiziAbedania"] bangs on a can of beef menudo (no lie!).  Recently added bassist, ["GriffinWalker"] is a cool, collected addition to this rockin' powerhouse.

Highlights:

 * Many ["Pirate Ship"] shows
 * Special Acoustic 'Goodbye' show at the birthdays of Jaizi and Griffin...everyone clad only in their bathrobes.
 * They won a battle of the bands in ["Dixon"] and won $100 dollars
 * Performed live on the air at ["KDVS"] 90.3FM

Jaizi, Joe, and Griffin are all incredibly hot.

There is an [http://www.playboymillionaires.com/ official Playboy Millionaires site.]  Who needs "official sites"? -- you probably just want to [http://www.playboymillionaires.com/songs.html check out a few of their songs.]
