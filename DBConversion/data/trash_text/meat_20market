A meat market is where people go to shop for "meat." By ''shop for'' I mean ''check out.'' By ''meat'' I mean ''other people.''  If you're smooth, you might get lucky and get some ["ass"] at these places.

Davis Meat Markets include:

  * The ["Rec Pool"]
  * The ["ARC"]
  * DJ Dance nights at ["The Graduate"], ["Cantina del Cabo"], and (new!) ["Pasta" Pasta?]

This is not to be confused with the Davis ["Farmers Market"], where people sometimes sell meat, or the ["Meat Lab"].
