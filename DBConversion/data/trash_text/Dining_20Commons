The Dining Commons, or DC for short, are where ["Freshmen"] living in the dorms are forced to eat. All ["Freshmen"] living in dorms are required to buy a meal plan through [http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/ UC Davis Student Housing] but anybody can purchase meals at the dining commons. All of the DCs are run by the corporate giant ["Sodexho"]/Marriot, the largest food service provider in America. Sodexho also controls ["The Silo"] and the Cafe at the ["ARC"].

Meal plans work on "swipe card" system where the residence hall students may enter the DC and pay with a swipe with their ["reg card"] which has been pre-encoded with a certain dollar value. The student may then eat as much of anything as he or she pleases and consequently gains the ["Freshman Fifteen"]. Swipes can also be used to purchase snack items at the DC "store," but this is generally considered to be a rip-off (See [http://www.californiaaggie.com/article/?id=697 Aggie article]).

Those who don't live in the res halls can pay at the door with cash or a credit card, but other than the "all you can eat" aspect, people might not be willing to pay to eat there. Sodexho also has a ["Munch Money"] system that can be bundled with a meal plan or purchased separately. Munch money can be used at any ["Sodexho"] run food trough on campus.


There are three dining main commons on campus:
 * ["Segundo Dining Commons"]
 * ["Tercero Dining Commons"]
 * ["Oxford Circle Dining Commons"] -- serving the Cuarto area
There is also a smaller ["Castilian Dining Commons"] which serves the Castilian area.

The overcrowded ["Segundo Dining Commons"] -- which currently serves Primero Grove, Segundo North, Regan Hall and the highrises -- will be replaced by a new Segundo Dining Commons upon completion. See ["University Construction"].
