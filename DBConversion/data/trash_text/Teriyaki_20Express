A cheap place to get some grub, especially if you are living in the ["Dorms"] and are tired of the ["Dining Commons"]!  This place will give you, basically, a bowl full of meat -- all covered in teriyaki sauce and over rice.  Seriously good stuff.  Slathering the meat/rice bowl in ["Hot Sauce"] provides a good treat, too.
