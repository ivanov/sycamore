Originally American Legion Post 61, the Avalon nightclub is divided into two rooms, both featuring generously sized bars plus another bar on the outdoor patio. 

In the club's bigger dance hall, house music blasts while in the smaller space - the so-called "social lounge" - the vibe is much more intriguing on Saturday nights. Here, aided by DJ Solis, the room pulsates with Latin and tropical beats and energetic salsa dancing. Latin salsa takes over the bigger dance hall for a $5 cover on Sundays from 7pm-midnight with free lessons at 7pm.

Admission is $10 before 10pm and $15 after. Drinks range from $3 to $6. DJ dancing from 9pm-2am Wednesdays-Saturdays.
