This is possibly the most unintentionally disturbing piece of public art in Davis. The "Davis Family Mural" was created by local artists along with children from the [http://www.familiesfirst.org/ FamiliesFirst] program.

This piece is part of the City of Davis' "Art in Public Places" program, which seeks to "purchase art that enhances the quality of the Davis environment."

After looking at the mural for a bit, you begin to realize the environment the city hoped to promote: that of absolute terror.

The mural is located on the corner of 3rd and G Street, right next to the Davis Enterprise.
