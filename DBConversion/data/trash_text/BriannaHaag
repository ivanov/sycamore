Brianna is a second year communications major and lives in ["Arlington Farms"] with the rest of the cool sophomores. And by "cool", we really mean alcoholic. She is looking forward to ["houseboats"] which is probably the best weekend ever, as well as ["arrowjam"] which her sorority has already began practicing for. She loves to workout at the ["ARC"] and eats ["Pluto's"] at least once a week. She will be living in the ["Alpha Phi"] house next year which is on Russell Blvd and she is currently VP Marketing as well as webmaster for the website. She is from San Diego and works as a tour guide at Sea World over summer. She loves meeting new people and is currently a member of the ASUCD ["Senate"].
