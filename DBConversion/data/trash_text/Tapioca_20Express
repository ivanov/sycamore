Tapioca Express is a tapioca (also know as pearl tea or boba) franchise with a [http://www.tapiocaexpress.com scary website].  Their Davis location is well known for having some sort of ["DDR"] machine. It probably costs money to play.

Tapioca Express has many types of Tea (green, black, snow), italian sodas, and a limited food selection.  Food includes deep fried chicken and tofu, as well as rice to go with.  You can order most of the drinks with or without boba, which is a large tapioca pearl.  They provide large-diameter straws so you can drink them through the straw.

''Tapioca Express is also notorious for not allowing substitutions. Even if it is taking the meat out of an item. They will give you less and and make you pay more.''  The calamari tastes quite different from the italian version you might be used to.  It has a cinnimon flavor, even when ordered "plain" (meaning not spicy).

They've since put up a sign indicating this, but you can be caught offguard with bits of chicken in your tofu dish. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]------
