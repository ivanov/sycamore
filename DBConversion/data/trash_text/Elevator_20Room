There is a small room in ["Robbins Hall"] that is dedicated to the elevator.  Once you walk into the building, there are about 3 or 4 stairs, and there is some ramp around back.  However, I guess they decided to make the elevator wheelchair accessible.  So... there is an elevator room.  It used to have chairs in there, but it seems that they have since found a new home.  It's kind of quirky, I suggest you check it out.  Perhaps, ride the elevator up 2 feet of stairs to the first floor.
