Pita Pit is a Canadian chain that offers delicious pitas and salads.  You pick the type of pita you want, such as "Chicken Crave" or "Philly Steak," then pick the veggies and sauces while the hot ingredients are grilled.  The pitas are delicious, if nothing else then by virtue of choosing exactly what goes in it from many ingredients, and are a healthy and unique alternative to the other late-night dining options, such as Jack-in-the-Box or Del Taco.

They offer a ton of vegetarian options.

The "customize your pita" concept is powerful, but sometimes too powerful!  If you order a Falafel (an especially popular item if you're a vegeterian) there are a few things to keep in mind.  They usually ask when you order a Falafel whether or not you'd like the falafel balls cooked in the microwave (the grill is where they cook all the meat, and if you're a strict vegeterian that's usually gross).  If they don't ask, then just say you'd like the balls cooked in the microwave and they will gladly do that.  The other thing to keep in mind is that you should probably get the '''Tahini''' sauce on the Falafel (they always just ask you what sauce you'd like).  This is the traditional sauce and will make the Falafel taste like an actual ''Falafel''.  (Tzatziki sauce is also good on Falafel)

However, if you are not a vegetarian, but you want to order a vegetarian pita, be sure to tell them that they don't need to change their gloves.  Otherwise, they will waste a pair of gloves just to make your one pita.

Other items have "traditional" styles (such as the Chicken Caeser) that you can ask for.

The Pita Pit has indoor seating for about 15, outdoor seating for an army of hungry pita eaters, and a delivery as long as you get your order in by about 2am (for a small fee).

They also take credit cards.
