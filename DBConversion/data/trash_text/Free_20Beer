"Free beer", a phrase that will send the hearts of many college students into a flutter, is entierly possible in a college town such as Davis.

Places to find free beer include:

 * ["Frat Parties"]
 * ["Bro Parties"]
 * Random parties that you just happen to walk into
 * Parties that your friend throws -- general party etiquite dictates that you should invite said friend to a party at later date featuring free beer

Free beer is often, but not always is paired with free booze. Please note that free booze is to be regarded with a degree of suspicion as it is easier to spike than beer from a keg or a can. Also, do not accept free beer in a cup from strangers, rather fill the beer from the keg yourself.

As the saying goes, there's no such thing as a free lunch; it would follow that  there are some disadvantages to free beer as well.

Disadvantages of free beer:

 * Free beer often shitty beer -- see ["Natty Ice"]
 * Increases risk of ["Date Rape"]
 * Having to hang out with ["Bros"] and ["Frat Boys"]
 * Having ["Bros"] and ["Frat Boys"] hit on/molest you

Free Beer (like all other beer) is made from yeast. Yeast are budding fungi that excrete alcohol under anaerobic conditions. An interesting UC Davis fact is that Emil M. Mrak (as in Mrak hall) was a food science professor who studied yeasts. He has two species named for him: Williopsis mrakii and Zygosaccharomyces mrakii. - ["The Saprophyte"]
