Davis is known worldwide for being somewhat ''weird''.  In fact, the town has been featured in "News of the Weird" for the infamous ["Potholes" pothole] uproar, the infamous ["Toad Tunnel" toad tunnel] and the ["Snoring" snoring] incident.  And then there is the fact that we are a ["nuclear free zone" nuclear free] city, a pro-choice city, and have one of the strictest smoking ordinances in the country. Rebellions to the weird establishment of Davis come in the form of a ["Conservative Coming Out Day"], which ironically adds to the weirdness of Davis.

"People's Republic of Davis" or PRD, by analogy with PRC, "People's Republic of China," is a vaguely disdainful term used to highlight this insularity of Davisites, particularly when the ["City Council" local government] has done something especially silly.  The term "People's Republic of Davis" is rumored to have been coined by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Limbaugh Rush Limbaugh] during the ["Toad Tunnel"] and pothole controversies.

Another possible source for the phrase:
  "Another of the city's critics was a railroad executive who couldn't hide his annoyance when officials asked his company in the early 1990s to contribute up to $1,000 for a planning project the city was undertaking next to the railroad tracks. 'This letter is tantamount to railroad robbery. However, since we are forced to live with the People's Republic of Davis, we will accede to your demands in the interest of the commune welfare,' the executive wrote in response, enclosing a check for $500." --[http://www.city.davis.ca.us/pb/cultural/30years/chapt10.cfm source]
