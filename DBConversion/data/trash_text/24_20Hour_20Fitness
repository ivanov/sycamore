24 Hour Fitness is a chain gym. They offer weight equipment and classes, 24 hours a day / night (almost).

You can sign up for spinning (cycling) classes 30 minutes before the class start time.  At Downtown Plaza's 24 hr fitness, you can sign up for all classes 1 hr before the class start time.

I can't say enough about how poorly I rate 24 Hour Fitness. The first time I went in, I was shopping around for a new Davis gym and just wanted to check out their facilities and prices; it was 10pm and the person at the front counter couldn't/wouldn't give me a price and instead told me I had to come back during regular hours to speak with a 'counselor'. She did let me wander through the facility on a self-guided tour though, and I was surprised to find it pretty crowded at that time of night and downright stanky! No air movement... just thick sweaty air like in a high school locker room. The facilities include a lap pool and sauna, but the lap pool is in a small, even 'sweatier' room and who needs to sit in a sauna when you've already waded through the outer sauna where stairmasters and ellipticals are packed arm-to-arm with only three feet of airspace between you and two more rows? This wasn't my only visit to this particular 24 Hour though, because in 2004 I signed up, desperate for a cheap short term gym in preparation for an expedition. I went to that stinky hole for three months straight around 11pm each night and it was *still* nasty!!
