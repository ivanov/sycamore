The Women's Center is on the east side of campus near the ["MU"].  They have a small library with books on "chicky" topics, and if you look hard enough, there's probably at least one or two books full of erotic lesbian stories.  In the library are some tables and seats plus two Macs for students to use.  

There's also a Righteous Babe lounge that is often quite warm and toasty in the winter and great for rainy days.  It's a small, quiet room that is good for studying in and sometimes comes with pretzels.  There are couches in there plus pillows, but unfortunately, there is a sign posted that says No Sleeping...but no one obeys or enforces that rule.
