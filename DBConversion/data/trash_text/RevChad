Reverend Reverend Brother Saint Chad Van Schoelandt, Pope and Patriarch, Tsar and Emperor
AKA ["ChadVanSchoelandt"][[BR]]

["RevChad"], is a cofounder of ["Students for an Orwellian Society"], and was a senate candidate for ["SOSSS"] in Fall 2004. He is currently a candidate with ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"] and has taken a major role in authoring a set of election reform bills for ASUCD. He wishes ["Senate"] would take democracy more seriously, and do more to fully represent the students. He believes they do not take rights seriously enough, and that they funnel money to ["Frat Row" special interests]. One of his top projects is trying to get ["GASC"] to offer an abstinence program called "["KenBloom" Ken Bloom] Teaches You How Not to Get Laid."
  ''It's a good thing I don't drink coffee, because I'm laughing so hard it would come out my nose. -- ["KenBloom"]''
