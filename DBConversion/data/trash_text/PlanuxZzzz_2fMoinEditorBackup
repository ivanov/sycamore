== UC Davis Arboretum ==
attachment:sign.jpg

According the [http://arboretum.ucdavis.edu/ official UC Davis Arboretum site], the UC Davis Arboretum is:

    * a living museum
    * an outdoor classroom
    * a public garden with over 4,000 kinds of trees and plants
    * a beautiful place for active recreation or peaceful contemplation

Might I also add:
    * a romantic place to take a date on an evening walk

The UC Davis Arboretum occupies 100 acres of land along the south edge of campus, along the banks of the old north channel of Putah Creek.  

== The Waterway ==
This stretch of waterway is now a fairly stagnant pool rather than a working creek and various experiments in aeration can be found along the eastern part of the creek.  There is one large, central, lake area, immediately east of Mrak Hall.  This lake is commonly referred to as Lake Spafford (location: 38.3215N by 121.4449W) , so named for Lois Spafford.  He gave $20,000 to establish the Ed and Lois Spafford Endowed Arboretum Maintenance Fund. Her late husband, F. Edwin Spafford, was ASUCD President in 1953. From 1954 until his retirement in 1987, Ed made many lasting contributions to the University of California and to the Davis campus. Lake Spafford, near Mrak Hall in the UC Davis Arboretum, is named for Ed.

There is a working boat house at the (unnamed?) body of water west of Putah Creek Lodge.

== The Plant collections ==
There are 18 distinct plant groupins in the arboretum, maintained by the 1100+ member [http://arboretum.ucdavis.edu/Friends.htm Friends of the Arboretum] group, which is always [http://arboretum.ucdavis.edu/Join.htm looking for members] (which costs money), or you can [http://arboretum.ucdavis.edu/Volunteers.htm volunteer].  The plant collections are:

 * Storer Garden (Perennials for Central Valley gardens)
 * White Flower Garden & Gazebo
 * Shields Oak Grove
 * South African Collection
 * Mediterranean Collection
 * Early California Garden
 * South American Collection
 * Southwest US/ Mexican Collection
 * Acacia Collection
 * Conifer Collection
 * Valley Oak Grove
 * Desert Collection
 * California Foothill Collection
 * Mary Wattis Brown Garden (California native plants)
 * Redwood Memorial Grove
 * North Coast Collection
 * Australian Collection
 * Arboretum Terrace Home
 * Demonstration Garden

Each one features a different set of plants, and all survive or thrive in Davis's moderate meditterean climate.  The [http://arboretum.ucdavis.edu/Map.htm map] of the gardens will be helpful if you're looking for a specific plant group.

== Annual events ==
UC Davis's annual ["Picnic Day"] holds one major event in the arboretum: the ["Picnic Day Battle Of The Bands"].  Not to be missed!

Other events, focused around the plant and animal life present in the arboretum, are organized by the Friends of the Arboretum and are held at regular intervals.

== Animal life ==
One omnipresent creature in the arboretum area (and the nearby sections of Davis and the UC Davis campus) is the duck.

The ducks feed on grubs in the grassy areas surrounding the waterways of the arboretum and on the scrummy substance that lines the bottom of the waterways.

This is sometimes amusing to watch.

A plethora of other wildlife inhabit the arboretum, including pretty butterflies:

== What to do there ==
In addition to the afore-mentioned romantic walks, the arboretum is also used by inline roller-bladers, bicyclists and runners/joggers.  Most of the arboretum is not lit by streetlights at night, but crime in the Davis area is rare and the arboretum is, generally speaking, a safe place to spend time, even after dark.  With the arboretum's connection to the ["South Davis Bike Path"], it makes a useful bike-friendly alternate route between the Border's parking lot and the core of the UC Davis campus.
