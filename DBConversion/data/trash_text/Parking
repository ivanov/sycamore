== Parking on UC Davis Campus ==

When parking on ["Campus" UC Davis campus] , you fall under ["Transportation And Parking Services" TAPS] jurisdiction which has their own set of rules. Like other UC campuses, when you visit, you can purchase a one day parking pass which allows you to park in most parking spaces other than special spots such as President Provost spots for example.

== Parking in downtown Davis ==

When parking downtown, you are limited to 90 minutes to two hours of parking. Your vehicle will be usually marked with chalk as an indicator that you been in a given spot for a while.
''What time of day does this run from?''

''These bastards will come back EVERY TWO HOURS and give you another $30 ticket. They add up -["CaptainRush"]''

== Ignoring Parking Tickets ==

Ignore parking tickets from both UC Davis and the City of Davis at your own peril. If you are a California resident, you don't have much choice but to resolve the ticket since ignoring it would prevent you from renewing your tags. If you are a non-resident, a ["DMV" California DMV] lock would probably not be recognized in your home state unlike a speeding or another moving violation ticket. Ignoring a moving violation ticket can get your home state driver's license pulled.
