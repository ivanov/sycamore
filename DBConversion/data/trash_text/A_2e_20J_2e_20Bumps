A.J. Bumps is G Street Pub's long-dead predecessor from the mid-late eighties. It was something of a Republican version of the G Street... kinda like a cross between G Street and Sudwerk Brewery. It was still a pub-style restaurant with booths, waitress service, and I think they had live music as well.
