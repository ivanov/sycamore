= To Do (everybody!) =

 * '''Wiki stuff that's important to you -- socially, culturally, deliciously, etc.'''
 * Instead of a redirect to Front Page, edit the page ["Davis"] with some information about the town, for people who don't know anything about it.  Add links to ["Town History"], ["Davis Timeline"], ["Campus"], ["People's Republic of Davis"] and whatever else.
 * Organize ["People's Republic of Davis"] to mesh well with ["Weirdness"].  The info can probably be moved to PRD and Weirness removed?
 * ''Secret and underground passages'' - how about a page or two on the underground passages that connect buildings together?  Alledgedly there's also some underground way of getting to the UCD airport from Mrak, but this may be just a  legend. - ["JaimeRaba" jr]
  *See ["no toad sexing in Davis"] for an interesting (and true) story about underground passages on campus. -- ["DanMasiel"]
 * ''Wiki your Department''. I'm not really sure how good of an idea it would be to have people start noding Classes and Professors, but for right now there's certainly no reason for something like ["Psychology"] to be empty.
 * ''Wiki your Complex''. There are a ton of Apartment Complexes linked (though just as many still need to be), and hardly and of them have pages.  Remember when you were looking for a place?  Wouldn't it have been awesome to hear what people had to say about the various apartments?  The good, the bad, the-anything?  So create a page on your apartment complex and add it to ["Apartments"]! 
 * ''Help with the ["Front Page"]''
   * There is currently an ["Explore Sandbox"] for working out a better version of ["Explore"] and suggestions.
   * (likewise, making a copy of Front Page and naming it ["Front Page Sandbox"] would work for suggestions to the front page).
   * Help us pick a '''["Featured Page"]!''' -- Think a page is cool?  Or a page has potential to be awesome?  Then spice up the page and suggest it in ["Next Featured Page"]!
 * ''Photos'' -- Many pages contain no photos.  In general, we need photos for most everyplace.  While finding a random photo online might do for now, for lasting purposes, we need our own photos.
 * If you've only got 5 minutes, pick one of these pages: ["Wanted Pages"] and write it up.  
 

= Other Suggestions and Questions =
  * ''Useful information'' - The following statistics would be useful in figuring out what pages we should try and put into more of a hierarchy of pages, given attention to... and other development:  a sorted/sortable page of data indicating the number of hits per page, are the largest in size, have the most photos, how many times edited.  - ["JaimeRaba" jr]
  * Make it possible to edit events that you post (rather than delete them) -- ["ArlenAbraham"]

= Links to places =
 * We need to go through a lot of the stuff on the wiki and make sure it's as linked up and well-organized as we can.
 * Need a good place to put ["Title Index"] and some other important organizational tools.  We could put them on the ["Front Page"] in ["Explore"] but we need to re-organize ["Explore"] in few weeks (maybe).
   * Maybe we could have an I-Actually-Care page with the organizational pages linked on it?
== The following awesome pages aren't linked from anywhere..(except here)==
 * ["Entertainment"], ["Transportation"], ["Christmas in Davis"], ["Davis Children's Nutcracker"]
   * Play with ["Explore"] in ["Explore Sandbox"].  There is also a full list of ["Orphaned Pages"].

= Wiki Development To Do =
  * "external link" in visual editing toolbar should act similar to AIM's link UI.  Also, perhaps a few more items in the visual editor.
  * I think there should be some mechanism for having conversations on a per-page basis.  Some kind of 'subchannel data' that's part of the page, but not displayed by default, wherein we hash out philosophical differences re: page content and such.  It should be easy to update, support threaded discussion, and not be displayed in the main entry unless the user requests it.
    * See ["Talk Page debate"].
 * You can't have links in headers?  I've looked at the documentation, but I might still be wrong on this.  If I'm not, that should be fixed. --["ChrisTakemura" ct]
   * You're right.  This should be added.
 * A comment formating button could come in handy. Users would select text and press the button which would itallisize the comment and add their initials (with link to user's page). - ["ArlenAbraham"]
   * [[s(begin)]]Can't people just edit pages?[[s(end)]] Oh!  You mean in the toolbar!  Yes, excellent idea.  We also need the url button to work better (the way it does in AIM), strike, and maybe some others. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
 * RSS on ["Recent Changes"] should have link to the diff rather than just the page. --["PhilipNeustrom"]
 * Refactor editlog information:  There should be an editlog per-page as well as a main editlog.  This would speed up the Info tab as well as the watchlist.

''2005-01-22 12:18:16'' [[nbsp]] We need a list of good auto mechanics. It's very valuable information. --["AlexGourley"]------
''2005-01-22 13:41:14'' [[nbsp]] ["Automobile Repair"] is a list, but only two pages have been made on shops.. --["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2005-01-23 14:28:51'' [[nbsp]] the page info should have a list of inbound links as well as outbound --["ArlenAbraham"]
  * Terrific idea.
