Slates are ["ASUCD"] candidates' version of political parties on ["Campus"].  Well, they're kind of political parties.  Actually, they're more like cliques, with each candidate getting his or her friends to run in future elections.  Independent candidates:  just not cool enough to be with ["Student Focus" Focus].

== Slates ==
Currently active slates include:
  * ["Student Focus"]
  * ["L.E.A.D."]
  * ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"]
Previous slates are discussed in ["Senate History"]

== Slates: A Misnomer ==
Generally speaking, slates are coalitions of candidates who team up to campaign for an office during a single election.  Political parties differ in that they have members who are not candidates for office, they field candidates in multiple elections, and they tend to vote as blocks.  Clearly what we have on campus at least in Focus and Lead are political parties and not slates.  Why the wrong terminology then?  Perhaps its to combat cynisism towards national political parties, or perhaps its the identification of lead and slate both being types of rock.

== Benefits of Running on a Slate ==
Slates offer a lot of benefits that running as an independent could never offer.  Independents may have street cred, but slates already have an open door into many organizations.  Fraternities traditionally supports Student Focus.  ["On Campus Co-ops" Co-op] people clearly support the Friends.  LEAD, um, well, I'm sure they have some constituents.

Slates also have a past history.  This can be a ["Campaigning in Dorms Controversy" disadvantage], but people are more likely to support your cause if you helped them in the past.  Brand name recognition is key, and many slates wear clothing to show [[s(begin)]]gang[[s(end)]] slate affiliation.  LEAD wears catsup red, Focus wears mustard yellow, and Friends Urging Campus Kindness wears punk-rockish spray-painted stencil art on shirts.

And on a slate, one person does not have to go to every group.  Fellow candidates can pick up the slack.  And, just for note:  the less a slate expects your vote, the less people they send to your ["Student Organizations" club] meeting.  This tactic of allowing an ambush of the poor candidate assigned to go to ["Davis College Republicans"] isn't very effective at getting votes, but that person has the least status in the clique and thus deserves to be sent.

Of course, the most important benefit of being on a slate is below:

== Kickbacks ==
It doesn't matter too much if you lose, as long as some of your friends get elected -- your friends on ["Senate"] or the ["ASUCD President"] will get you a nice job on a commission.  People who are well liked by officers but generally unelectable get the best prize: a seat on the ["Health and Wellbeing Committee"]!  Those guys have produced an average of 0 events each year over the last 3 years, and get paid to do it.  

In addition, the President gets a $20,000 discretionary fund.  It has a good chance of shoring up the support of a key constituency, though it has been used for ["Black Caesar" other reasons] as well.  It's like Senator ["Gabe Bang"] said at a Senate meeting, "[It would be really hard for my fraternity to have raised that much money; it's a lot better to raise student fees by a dollar or two.]"  Slates back you up, and protect you from ["California Aggie" unnecessary press].
