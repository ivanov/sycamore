Wellman is located across from the west side of ["The Quad"], and is next to ["Kerr Hall"] and ["Hart Hall"].  Wellman is home ''only'' to classrooms, featuring no labs and only a few offices. It also features a study lounge, which is convenient to ["Study Spots" study] or ["Sleeping On Campus" sleep] in in-between classes in Wellman. Practically everyone ends up having classes in Wellman every quarter.  It's one of the most convenient locations to have classes because of the proximity to the ["Memorial Union"]. The largest classroom/lecture hall in Wellman is ["Wellman 2"].

Wellman also features ["WiFi Hot Spots" wireless access].  There is a [http://wireless.ucdavis.edu/WellmanMap.htm coverage map] on [http://wireless.ucdavis.edu].  This balances the fact that most cellphones get no reception in or around the rear of the building.  (At a time now past, "The Pit of Wellman" was notorious for this problem.)

There is a pathway from the basement of ["Kerr Hall"] to the basement of Wellman.  This pathway is usually locked from the Wellman->Kerr direction, but not the Kerr->Wellman direction.  This means if you're in Kerr, then you can always get into Wellman.

Wellman has a number of DVD players hooked up to huge screens in various classrooms -- perfect for watching a movie (provided there's no class in there).

Other buildings on campus are detailed at ["Campus Buildings"].
