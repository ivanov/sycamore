Endora used to be called Enduro when she belonged to someone else, but her new owners didn't have an extreme interest in rock climbing, so they renamed her. She lives with the Z twins: ["SharonZimmerman" Sharon] and ["AmyZimmerman" Amy]. And ["ScottBiggart" Davis Coeds Scotty] too. Seeing as Endora was adopted from Sharon's old roommate Vineta she belongs to Sharon.

Endora shares a cage with ["Po the Rat"] and really misses her sister Delores, who passed away in November of 2004.
