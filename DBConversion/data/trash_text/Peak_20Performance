Friendly certified personnel, a wide range of cardio and resistance training equipment, and exercise classes to suit every level of fitness. This club also offers free child care and a separate Women's Only workout room.

I've been in Davis for some time and have, at various times been a member at the Rec Hall [pre-ARC], 24-Hour, Davis Athletic Club, and Peak Performance. At one point I let my Peak membership lapse and tried a brief stint at 24-Hour... I came back to Peak in a hurry! Unlike 24-Hour, Peak is a very clean, well-ventilated facility. Though the hours are shorter, the cleanliness and friendliness of the staff are well worth adjusting my schedule a bit. DAC was a great gym, and it offers a wider range of facilities, including a full size pool & sauna, but their prices reflect all the extras that I just wasn't making use of. The Rec Hall was a drag because it would close for events like concerts, graduation ceremonies, etc... now that it's expanded though, things might be different. The other downside to the Rec Hall is that it would get ridiculously crowded during peak hours and I absolutely refuse to go to a gym and have to sign up and *wait* for a piece of equipment. Heck, it's hard enough to drag my butt down there without wasting another twenty waiting for a stairmaster! And as for 24-Hour, well, I think I'd classify it as the ghetto gym... overcrowded, stanky, dirty, and staffed by steroid pumped bouncers who can't even give you a straight line about how much a membership costs.
