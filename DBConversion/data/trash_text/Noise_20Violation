Tension is what makes life interesting and apparently the city of Davis has decided to add some flavor to the student experience by creating Draconian noise codes and putting twice as many ["Noise Police"] on duty to harass students or for that matter anyone looking to have a good time (audible over the property line) on weekends.

A noise violation usually costs a little under $200.  If you are at a party and a noise violation is issued, it's good form to make a contribution to the cost if you can.  Better yet, make sure to comply promptly if you are asked by the host to keep it down or to go inside (many noise violations are issued for noise from somebody's back yard).

You can try to avoid getting a noise violation by applying for a noise permit. Don't be rude to the ["Noise Police"] because they will eat you alive.

The most ''concise'' information on the law for issuing noise violations as well as how to obtain a permit can be found in the city's [http://www.city.davis.ca.us/police/pdfs/forms/Noise_Permit_Application_and_Instructions.pdf Noise Permit Application].

 * One note about noise permits. If your house has already received a noise violation then the police will not issue you a noise permit. - ["RobRoy"]

''(It might be good to translate over the 3 types of violations to this page at some point)''

An enterprising soul with access to research equipment and a history with the  Noise Violation officer once made a survey of several Davis locales using a decibel meter.  His conclusion was that on most streets at most times the ambient noise is louder than the Noise Violation threshold.  So don't expect to be able to argue that your party wasn't actually loud enough to qualify.  Your party is always loud enough to qualify.  Your only hope is to avoid having a complaint made against you by a neighbor or enemy, the ["Davis Police Department" Noise Police] only spring into action when they receive a complaint.  Invite your neighbors!

As a note of interest, shortly after the noise ordinance went in to effect in the mid 90's, there were some very angry people, amongst them DJ Jeyson (now in San Diego) and Chris Doherty (a.k.a Chris Sequioa), who cited a neighbor, Sari Zayed, for ["Snoring"] too loudly.  More can be found out in this dusty ancient ["Usenet FAQ" Davis, CA FAQ] and [http://www.google.com/search?q=snoring+davis+%22noise+ordinance%22 here].

''2004-12-20 09:36:32'' [[nbsp]] After having a performance of our kids band shut down when they had a permit and had only been playing for 15 minutes, I've often wondered what would happen if I called the police and complained that the noise from Toomey Field or from the Davis High School football field was bothering me!  Think they'd shut down the game?  I doubt it! - ["BevSykes"]

''2004-12-20 12:01:22'' [[nbsp]] Dude, try it! - ["KenjiYamada"]------
''2004-12-20 15:12:43'' [[nbsp]] ["Pirate Ship" My house] has followed the rules and tried to get noise permits and after paying the 25 dollar fee to file for one (and telling all our neighbors) we fail every time. - ["RobRoy"]

''2004-12-20 15:34:21'' [[nbsp]] Rob - have you ever figured out who is filing the complaints?  If they aren't public, are you sure you aren't being (illegally, it seems, according to the above) hassled directly by the police department? - ["JabberWokky"]------
''2004-12-20 16:15:18'' [[nbsp]] oh its the neighbors. But we talk to them now. We haven't gotten a nose violation in two months. BUT when we did we got two at 9:30 in the evening. And they threatened to take a ["Pirate Ship" housemate] to ["Yolo County Jail" jail]. And they entered the backyard without being allowed to. - ["RobRoy"]

''2004-12-21 21:13:04'' [[nbsp]] If the ambient level of noise exceeding the permissible level is indeed the truth, I wonder if the rule would stand in court?  hmm..  I might just help someone fight one of these just to find out. - ["JaimeRaba"]------
''2004-12-21 21:41:27'' [[nbsp]] We have had bands playing in our living room (after we put sound board and mattresses against the windows and doors) and then asked our ["Mature Davisites" next-door neighbor] if everything is all right and she has said, "I can't hear a thing." - ["RobRoy"]------
''2005-01-15 10:43:55'' [[nbsp]] we had actually JUST asked the next door neighbor if she could hear anything the NIGHT both joe and i got noise violations, to which she answered 'i can't hear anything'. however, we've since decided that it was not the music but the people out back making enough noise to bother the neighbors.  regardless, the police officer who wrote both tickets broke several regulations and behaved EXTREMELY rude to me, even though i was being perfectly cooperative in accepting the ticket, in fact, he went as far to write joe a ticket as well, just for walking up to ask what was going on.  My court date is next week, and we'll see what happens. --["LisaDavis"]------
''2005-01-26 20:25:55'' [[nbsp]] Does any one have advice whether pleading not guilty is worth the trouble? We got a violation at 10:50pm on a Friday because the security guard at our apartment complex saw about 10 people coming up to our apartment. Our downstairs neighbor said he couldn’t hear anything. Officer York was rude and made some baseless claims about a couple of our friends who headed back up to the apartment with In-N-Out having “bags of weed” in their bags. --["DerekEllis"]
