Muir Commons are located in West Davis and is a part of Aspen Development.

It was the first ["Cohousing"] community newly constructed in the United States and was modeled after communities in Denmark. After several years of planning, ground breaking took place on November 1990 with the residents moving in during the summer of 1991. Most of the homes were constructed as affordable housing.

Their web site is located at ("http://www.muircommons.org").
