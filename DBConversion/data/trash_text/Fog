In the winter, ["Davis"] becomes shrouded in fog. Not only is this beautiful, but it adds to the fun of late ["Night Time" night] lightless ["Bars" drunken] ["Bicycling" bike] riding. Fog in ["Central California"] is pretty amazing and far surpasses the fog found in the famous ["Bay Area" Fog City]. It makes driving very dangerous and is responsible for numerous massive 100+ car pileups. In town, the fog is usually thickest in the morning which is a welcome respite to the often bone chilling winter ["Weather"].
