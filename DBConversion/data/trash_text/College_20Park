College Park is not just a park, but an upscale neighborhood, across the street from ["UC Davis"] and built in a big circle. The earliest homes in College Park were built over 70 years ago, and were considered "out in the country" (Miller Drive and A Street north of Fifth was a sheep pasture until after WWII). The house on the corner of College Park and ["Russell"] Blvd. is the ["International House" I-House], which is next door to the home designated for use by the ["Larry Vanderhoef" Chancellor] of UC Davis.

College Park is also the name of the road that loops through College Park. At the northern end of the loop the road makes, there are barriers so no cars may pass between College Park and the end of Eureka Avenue that is just south of Eighth Street.  ["Bicycles"] and ["Pedestrians"] may pass through, however. The wooden poles that block vehicular access were placed there largely because of students and other UC-related folk using College Park as a shortcut between Fifth and Eighth.

The big grassy area at the southern end of the block formed by the loop College Park (the road) makes is called "College Park" on maps of Davis.


 * College Park is the most beautiful neighborhood in Davis.  I advise pedestrians and bikers to go out of their way to use it to get between Fifth and Eighth Streets.  -["RishiTrivedi"]
