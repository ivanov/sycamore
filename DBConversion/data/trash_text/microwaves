Looking for a place to make your food hot again? Here's a listing of public microwaves!

 * Campus
   * ["Olson Hall"] -- In the basement by the vending machines
   * ["Coffee House"] -- One by the south entrance next to the newspaper racks. Two more by the west entrance.
   * ["The Silo"] 
   * ["CSIF Support"] in room 47 of ["Kemper Hall"] (in basement) -- ''I wouldn't call CSIF Support's microwave "public", but we're generally happy to let you use it, just ask first. You'd be surprised how many rude individuals just run in and help themselves to whatever is in the room...'' - ["ElvinLee" Elvin]
