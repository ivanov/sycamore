The legend of Nam Turk began in East San Jose circa 1983. He was borne of muck and filth, since he was conceived by sewer rats. Obviously, he lived in the sewer, as well, kinda like that clown It except without the facepaint and child-eating tendencies. Also, Nam Turk is not played by Tim Curry of ''Legend'' and ''Home Alone 2'' fame. So anyway, growing up in the urban squalor meant that Nam Turk was exposed to the seedy underbelly of society. Murders, robberies and even Vanilla Coke were not uncommon in the life of the young Turk boy. In school, he excelled greatly due to his streetwise instincts and badass Airwalks which gave him the confidence needed to succeed. He got hella good grades and, thus, many fine bitches. They were all up on the Nam Jock like Asians on rice (I think that's the phrase). Needless to say, the Kingdom of San Jose was eventually conquered; its bitches fucked and its schools PWN3D. Nam Turk felt compelled to expand his empire. He looked across the horizon to the small, elitist, Nazi township of Davis, which caught his eye. There he brought his majesty and mad skillz to a new world of people for him to be cooler than. For three years now, Nam Turk has ruled over the bros, sluts, crusty townies, short Asian girls who can't ride bikes, scenester douchers, artfags and incompetent police of Davis, California, and he shall continue to do so for many years to come or until he graduates and leaves this shithole.
