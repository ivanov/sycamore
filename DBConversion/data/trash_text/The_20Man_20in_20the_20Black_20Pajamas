There is not much to say about the Man in Black Pajamas except the following:

 1. It was originally known as "The Chinamen"
 2. It was the indiest band in Davis history by all accounts and definitions. 
 3. Their status was put to the test by indie sensation Mexico. The resulting battle ended with the shooting death by police of a 26 year old Yolo County Man on 14 December, 2004.    
 4. The band played the shortest ever set in Delta of Venus history, clocking in at a mere 7 minutes. 
 5. At least one member scored with a high school girl as a result of the band's influence and prestige.
