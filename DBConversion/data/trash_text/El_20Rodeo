=About=
El Rodeo is the official Undegraduate yearbook of ["UC Davis"].  Graduating seniors can get their portraits taken for the yearbook free of charge during Fall and Winter quarters.

The El Rodeo Yearbook is a hard bound book averaging about 300 pages. It is split into 7 sections that include student life, academics, athletics, freshmen, seniors, greeks & organizations, and ads & index. Each section, with the exception of ads & index, is made up of different feature stories and photographs. It is created entirely by students during fall and winter quarter and published by Herff Jones, Inc. 

==History==
The first yearbook was published in 1911 under the original name, Agricola. During this time it was a small soft bound book with 100 pages or less. There was even a pop-up yearbook that was published during this time. Agricola's content was primarily literary-letters, jokes, poems, and agricultural articles, with a few pictures and a sports section. In 1917 the title of the book was changed to Farm Rodeo and again in 1922 to The Rodeo. The content of the book expanded during this time to include headshots of students and features on Homecoming and ["Picnic Day"].  In 1928, it was renamed El Rodeo, symbolizing both the Spanish fiesta and the "round-up" of the year's school activities. By the late 1960's, El Rodeo, primarily pictorial, was a book of 300 pages.
