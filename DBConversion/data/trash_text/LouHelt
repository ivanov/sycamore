Lou is a freshman at Northern Arizona University and a proud graduate of ["Davis Senior High School" DHS]. She's majoring in German with a minor in Forestry and plans to do... well... something with her life. sometime in the near future. She's moving back to Sacramento in the fall and really, honestly, can't wait one bit.
