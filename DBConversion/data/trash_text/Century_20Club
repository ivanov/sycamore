The ultimate test of ["Alcohol"] tolerance.

[[center(end)]]

Century Club is pretty straightforward: 100 shots of beer, 100 minutes. Similar in concept to ["Power Hour"], Century Club is simply the next step, a ["Drinking games" drinking game] for the truly hardcore. Be warned, that it gets very hard to keep track of time, or how many shots one has completed, therefore an alarm every minute, or CD mix (100 songs, 1 minute each) or DVD mix (100 music videos, 1 minute each) is a recommended alternative rather than to simply watching the clock.

So, with that, I invite you all to share your century club stories.
