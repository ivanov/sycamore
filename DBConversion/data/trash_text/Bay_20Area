= Introduction =

Over Forty percent of the Davis student population are Bay Area natives. Oakland, San Francisco, and San Jose serve as anchor cities for the nine-county region (Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma).

Though the region is heavily populated, the Bay Area is reknowned for maintaining much of its natural beauty. The bay, pacific coastline, and diverse geography create a spectacular urban setting. The fringes of the Bay Area can be reached in about an hour from Davis driving west on ["Interstate 80"].

''2004-12-12 13:03:46'' [[nbsp]] I think the East Bay begins with Richmond.  I mean, how can you have Bay Area without BART?  - ["JaimeRaba"]------
''2004-12-12 17:10:10'' [[nbsp]] Traditionally the Bay Area is defined by the nine county region: Napa, Sonoma, Contra Costa, Solano, Napa, Alameda, Santa Clara, San Francisco, San Mateo. Although it is true Vallejo/Benicia are the boundary part with Fairfield being a stretch. - ["JamesDawe"]
