Watermelon Music is a great store for buying (new or used) or renting electric pianos, drums, guitars, violins, violas, and cellos.  They also have a variety of other instruments.  

They have a pretty good selection of sheet music in the back along with various learning tools.  The salespeople are always really friendly and knowledgeable and they do let you try out most of the instruments.  

Music lessons are also offered through the store. The ["Davis Music Teachers Association"] maintains a directory here as well.

At one time they offered a deal whereby guitar strings could be had at 2 for 1 prices if you paid using an old $2 bill.  Apparently $2 bills can still sometimes be purchased for 2 $1 bills at banks.  This special was related to the old store name, Second Street Music, and for sure was in effect before they changed locations and were renamed.  They would even occasionally give you a $2 bill in change to use for your next purchase.  The deal may or may not still be in effect. 

 * ''There's no "sometimes" or "purchase" about it - $2 bills are in active circulation and used (often given out in toll booths as change on turnpikes on the East coast, for instance).  As an active (although rare) currency, you can walk into any bank and ask for a stack of $2 bills, just like you can ask for a stack of $1 or $5 bills or a roll of quarters.  They make great bills for tips.  The most recent printing was in 2003, and more info can be found in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._two_dollar_bill Wikipedia entry].'' -- ["JabberWokky" jw]
