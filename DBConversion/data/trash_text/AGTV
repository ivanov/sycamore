AGTV or AggieTV is UC Davis' student television station. It is broadcast throught the dorms via ["ResNet"] cable TV services and will purportedly be avialable online in the near future.

Their [http://agtv.ucdavis.edu/ website] currently has nothing on it, thanks in large part to ["CreativeMedia"], the creators of the website.

''Despite living in the dorms, I have never seen anyhting produced by AGTV. I didn't even know what channel is was on.'' -- ["ArlenAbraham"]
