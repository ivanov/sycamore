Igor Birman is considered by many in ASUCD to be a sort of evil demigod, with super-human command of the legal system.  Those in the ASUCD administration that loathe him still tremble in indescribable terror when Igor announces pending legal consequences upon them.

Once the president of Davis College Democrats, Igor went on to become a prominent member of ["Davis College Republicans"], and having graduated from Davis has now ensconced himself in the national Republican Party.  Most recently he was reportedly supervising vote-counting observers in Ohio during the 2004 election.  The National Association of Parliamentarians certifies him as an expert in parliamentry law, and he hasn't even graduated Emory School of Law yet.

While still at Davis he successfully sued the ["California Aggie"] for improperly firing him (he was fired for being "too controvercial" as the conservative columnist.  Meanwhile incidently, ["John Green"] was advocating communist revolution as the liberal columnist).  In 2004 he publicly advised the ["ASUCD"] government that it was not legal for them to endorse candidates, to which they foolishly responded that yes it was and continued to do so.  Since then the IRS has gotten involved and informed the ["ASUCD"] government that "no really thats totally illegal" (paraphrased).  This situation has come to be known as "["Lamargate"]."

Currently, ["ASUCD"] is fidgeting very nerviously, as copies of the ["ASUCD"] tax returns for the last few years currently sit in a large manilla envelope on Igor's desk at home.


Though not necessarily in agreement with Igor's conservative tendencies, he is revered as the patron saint of legal uprightness in ASUCD by many at Davis.  Last time he came on campus he was soon recognized and asked for his autograph.  Its probably a good idea to get it, since Igor appears to be continuing to rise fast in national politics.

His most recent involvement in campus politics is that he advised ["SOSSS"] about the legal definition of "libel" for the SJA hearings against the ["Elections Committee"] about the ["Election Statement Controversy"].
