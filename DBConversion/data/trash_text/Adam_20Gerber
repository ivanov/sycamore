= Adam Gerber =

Adam is a ["History"] major and ["Political Science"] minor. He is a member of ["Alpha Epsilon Pi"]. His favorite book is "Men's Health Magazine".

He confused ["RevChad"] by having a magazine as his favorite book. This led Chad to wonder is Adam's favorite number is "Q."

He also happens to have been recently appointed to the ["ASUCD"] ["Senate"].

He lives in the infamous ["122"] with his fellow DAJJers - ["Jaclyn Fromer"], ["Jordan Steiner"], and ["Daniel Stone"] 

Here's Adam and Daniel meeting up in Israel. They like to fancy themselves as the most powerful roommates in Davis.

''Adam, I was the person who deleted the "dajj bathroom" page and the others.  If possible, I would ask you to please integrate those photos into the page where they are linked from.  Creating a separate page for a single photo clutters our ["Title Index"].  Pages should normally have a descriptive title and contain plenty of text.'' --["MikeIvanov"]
