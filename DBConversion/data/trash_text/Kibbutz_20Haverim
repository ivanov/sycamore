Kibbutz Haverim is the Jewish Student Union Co-op. It is located near ["Alpha Gamma Omega"], on campus. It can house between 10 and 14 people. All of the current residents are moving somewhere else at the end of this year, so all of these spaces are available in the 2005-2006 academic year. Visit the ["Hillel House"] for more information.

The name is Hebrew: &#1511;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1509; &#1495;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. For those who can't read Hebrew, Kibbutz Haverim should be pronounced [kibUts xAvajr\im] (transcribed according to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-SAMPA X-SAMPA] system).

''I would just say that the H should be pronounced like the ch in "Bach", but Americans tend to pronounce that wrong too. The sound doesn't exist in english.-- ["KenBloom"]''
