["DonovanKelley"] and ["TaylorStreet"] are part of the incestuous Davis Music Scene. They are members of The Backups, Keep Your Distance, and BxUxIx. 

Some Assholes play power-violence, fastcore, sludge or something like that. There is no way you could be cool enough to know. Stop listening to Modest Mouse and start listening to something with some balls (the music, not the musicians).

Oh yeah, and Some Assholes fucked your mom.
