The only 24 hour grocery shopping in Davis.  Sometimes people invent exciting games to play in aisles past 3am.  Some of these games can get you permanantly banned from Safeway.  But don't worry -- they just ban you one location at a time.

One of the managers at the North Davis location is ["Lamar Heystek"], a former ["ASUCD"] ["Senate" senator] and ["City Council"] candidate in March of 2004.

Now Safeway.com delivers to Davis, and the first delivery is free.  It is unclear as to whether any student has ever used this service, and whether one should tip the deliverer (since they charge a $10 surcharge anyway).

''2005-01-23 01:04:38'' [[nbsp]] Safeway has been in Davis for ages, but the company has an ongoing habit of closing one store and relocating to a different part of town each time a new development/shopping center opens. Former Safeway sites include the area that became State (Harvest) Market (now Cost Plus), the present location of the Co-Op, and the present location of the East Davis Nugget, to name a few.  --["CentralDavisite"]
