'''B'''ay '''A'''rea '''R'''apid '''T'''ransit. A light-rail system that runs both above and below ground (and water).
BART is accessible across from the ["Amtrak"] station platform in Richmond, granting car-free access to the rest of the ["Bay Area"].  If you're heading west and get off the ["Amtrak"] train in Richmond, you have to go downstairs, through the BART ticket counter, then back upstairs via escalator to access the BART platform.  Do note, however, that you can take ["Amtrak"] all the way into San Francisco.  Simply tell the ticket agent you're going to San Francisco and they can explain the relevant options or visit the ["Amtrak"] page for more details.

The closest BART station to Davis is the North Concord/Martinez station.  However, if you are driving to BART from Davis, it is worthwhile driving an extra 3.5 miles and starting your BART journey at the Walnut Creek station.  Without traffic (repeat, WITHOUT traffic), it takes just under 1 hour to drive from Davis to Walnut Creek BART Station. That time *will* go up substantially during the holidays and during commute hours.
 * It can take nearly five hours Christmas Eve morning to get from Davis to Walnut Creek.  Other holidays can be equally insane on I-80.  Keep in mind the travel time to the station on holidays.

Note that BART stops running fairly early at night.  The final train every night goes through San Francisco betweeb about midnight and 12:30 AM, through Oakland between about 12:30 AM and 12:45 AM, and arrives at the Walnut Creek station at 1:04 AM.  If you plan on attending an event that ends late (especially something like a concert that could run late past the official end time), it is a good idea to know the last BART available.

["Amtrak"] lists BART connections and schedules on their site, making it a one stop shop for planning Bay area trips sans car.

["Bicycles"] are allowed on BART, except during certain peak hours or on crowded cars.
