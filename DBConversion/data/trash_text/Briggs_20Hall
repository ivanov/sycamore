Briggs Hall, which looks like a citadel is approximately the same size, is a massive, grey concrete building on the West side of campus. The ["Life Sciences Addition"] is an addition to Briggs Hall and the two are physically connected. The monstrosity is home to many biological researchers as well as several teaching laboratories. However, all of the teaching laboratories will be moved to the Life Sciences Addition Addition (ok, well it's really called the ["Sciences Laboratory Buildings"], but both are horribly awkward) upon completion.

There's one of those ["University Construction"] signs in front of Briggs. Apparently it's being/going to be rennovated, though whatever change is taking place is probably going to be overlooked as it has to live under the shadow of the ["Sciences Laboratory Buildings"] construction that's blocked off the pathway next to briggs for something like two years.
