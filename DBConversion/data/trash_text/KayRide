KayRide, better known as Kalen Ridenour, is a relative newbie to the DavisWiki.  

Bio Stuff:

 * '''Year:''' 4th year, graduating SOON
 * '''Majors:''' ["Sociology"] w/ an emphasis in Law and Society; ["Spanish"]
 * '''Occupation:''' semi-proud to be a food server at ["Caffe Italia"]
 * '''Hometown:''' Sebastopol, CA
 * '''Career Aspirations:''' Something in the criminological field (FBI?  State Department?  Who knows?!)
 * '''Hobbies:''' Art (acrylics, sketching), writing, reading, fish-keeping, wiki-ing

Kalen wonders why people's personal DavisWiki pages are almost always in the third person, but she's going with it nevertheless. 

Kalen's three claim-to-fame's are:
 * Spending 6 months studying abroad in Chile (and visiting Peru, Argentina, and Bolivia)
 * Speaking at the Chancellor ["Larry Vanderhoef"]'s Fall 2004 Convocation
 * Having the same first name as ["Kalen Gallagher"]

In June of 2004, her life's quest was finally realized when she hiked up the ancient Peruvian mountain to see Machu Picchu.  


Kalen's goals for the Wiki are to add pics and commentary to ["West Davis"], so that people might better appreciate that side of town, as she is a third-year resident of West Davis and utterly enjoys living there. 

As if you care, these are Kalen's two cats, both of which excel at keeping her from studying:

They are significantly less freaky-looking in real life, and perhaps not cool enough yet to be featured in ["Wiki Animals"]

'''Kalen hopes that her senior year is not too late to get to know the more visible individuals on ["Campus"], especially those in the ["Wiki Community"], the ["LiveJournal"] community, and ["thefacebook"] community.'''

Perhaps someone can help this page not suck so hard.  That would be nice.
