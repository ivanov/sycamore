   * Café Fresca
   * ["Crepe Cart in the Silo" La Crepe]
   * Brenan's Starbucks--pours more than 6,000 beverages weekly. This is a mini ["Starbucks"] and doesn't serve all of the normal Starbucks drinks.
   * SubCity
   * Pizza Hut Express--biggest seller is its Supreme Pizza, which is boxed up and sold individually 1,200 times each week.
   * Carl's Jr.-- most popular product is the Famous Star hamburger. students consume 1,200 of them a week.
   * Taco Bell Express--2,800 tacos and 2,000 bean burritos are purchased weekly

It also has meeting/conference facilities, lounges and campus pub.  The Silo is run by ["Sodexho"], not by the University or ["ASUCD"].

In the South Silo are the ["Experimental College"], Student Special Services, ["Craft Center"], Graduate Student Association, and a branch of the ["UC Davis Bookstore"] serving the ["School of Law"]. 

The Silo has a ["microwaves" microwave] you can use to heat up your food (save some money and bring some leftovers with you).

 *''It kind of bothers me that there are outside commercial interests represented on a public university campus.'' - ["KenjiYamada"]
  *''Me too.  I think it's because the Silo is run by ["Sodexho"].  I'd much rather go to the ["Coffee House"]'' - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
   *''Yeah, I don't have a problem with ASUCD businesses.  At least their profits are all reinvested into the university.'' - ["KenjiYamada"]
    *''I only mind the worst outside interests--you can't really get rid of them all.  I just wish they weren't super-huge corporations.  Like I don't mind the crepe cart.  But I do mind the corporate fast food.  But yeah, CoHo generally does an impressive job.  I read somewhere that it's the biggest restaurant in Northern California.  Sodexho is also familar with huge restaruants-- they used to do all the catering for certain prisons, and apparently these substandard meals were the basis for several human rights lawsuits.  They apparently sold off that division, but really-- does that make them less cupable for any wrongs that may have occurred? '' - ["JaimeRaba" jr]
