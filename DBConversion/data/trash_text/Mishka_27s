Miskha's was founded in 1995 by UC Davis Graduate student Sinisa Novakovic and his former wife, Bobbi Bohart.  It is a café founded "in the Old World tradition: a cozy place to meet a friend, converse, read, and relax."  Miskha's is home to the only coffee roaster in Davis (though they usually refer to the city, in jest, as ["PRD" The People's Republic of Davis]), and they serve only organic and fair-trade beans.  On top of being "guilt-free," their coffee is consistently some of the best in Davis.  ''I beg to differ on this point.'' - ["KenjiYamada"]

Mishka's has reliable, fast ["WiFi Hot Spots" wireless access].  They are also home to the largest Apple laptop user base encountered at any of the Davis [wiki:Cafes cafes].  The people who frequent Miskha's are generally not undergraduates, rather, Graduate/Professional students, Professors, and business people pack the place late into the night.  The congregation of professionals and the bounty of expensive laptops leads to the impression that Miskha's is a snooty café.  

Then there is The Rule.

Mishka's is such a popular studying place that, by the late nineties, it became impossible for casual cafe-goers to find a table.  In response, Mishka's management declared some tables "study-free zones".  Attached to all the tables at the front of the café is The Rule.  Nowadays there's almost always a place to sit and flip through the day's San Francisco Chronicle, New York Times, Sacramento Bee, or ["The California Aggie" California Aggie].

Outside, they have a plastic fork and spoon holding open the ventilation.

One little (?) known fact is that the bathroom key also opens the janitor's room/utility closet left of the actual bathroom door. So, you know, go "explore." Funnily enough, you would think that a key connection between the janitor's room and the bathroom implies a clean bathroom, but think again!!  I sure hope all those sumptuous tasty pastries are delivered!

Their green-tea ice cream is delicious. Try one of Mishka's signature drinks, the '''Dark Balkan Night''' - a delicious tripple shot mocha!  The pastries are excellent, the truffles come from an artisanal chocolatier in The City.  The chicken piroshki leaves a little to be desired (or the contents to be wondered about)!

''They used to offer real whipped cream, but now use stuff from the can.  Bring back the real whipped cream!''

Overall, the café has good good atmosphere.
