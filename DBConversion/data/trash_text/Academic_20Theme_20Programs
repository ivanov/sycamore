'''Academic Theme Programs (ATPs)''' connect students with a shared academic interest by placing them together in the residence halls, typically on the same floor; students who sign up for an ATP also commit to a special one-unit fall quarter seminar that is held weekly within their residence hall. The idea is that many freshmen [most of the residence hall population] share the same coursework, so having them live together allows them to support eachother in getting through those core classes, helps them establish early connections with their academic peers, and more successfully immerses them in their area of interest through opportunities to meet profs and explore academic/career path options. ATPs are coordinated through [http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/ UC Davis Student Housing] and are available to students who have been offered a contract to live in the residence halls.
