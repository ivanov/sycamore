As this 13+ year old band's web page describes the music:

...there's New Orleans' second line and rhythm and blues, sure. But also, there's driving rockabilly and country waltzes. Singer/songwriter-style ballads. Ass-shaking cumbias. Edgy blues rock. Afro-Cuban trance singalongs. Conga-line-inspiring whachamacallits . Mutant gypsy folk. 

Mumbo Gumbo plays clubs, fairs, festivals, nightclubs, and their music was even used on a couple of episodes of "Northern Exposure."
