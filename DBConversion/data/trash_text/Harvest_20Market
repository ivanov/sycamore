This is an eulogy for Harvest Market.  Harvest Market was a Chinese-owned market which had one of best Asian foods sections of any of the Davis markets, and had a very excellent butcher department.  They had an amazing selection of fish and the standard meats, but what made this place better than most is that they sold in single-person portions rather than in those suited primarily for families.  They also had lots of different kinds of ["hot sauce"].  This made this place an amazing store.  

But now they're gone and now Davis dorm-dweller can have imported coffee beans and Danishes from ["Cost Plus World Market" Cost Plus] instead.  

["JaimeRaba" jr]: ''If Davis had to let in a big chain store into the heart of town, why did it have to be one that is going to put all the trinket stores in Davis out of business, instead of one that is actually useful to the student population it is immediately adjacent to?''
