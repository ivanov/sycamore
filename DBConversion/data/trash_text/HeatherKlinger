Describe HeatherKlinger here = 

Heather has lived in Davis, CA for about 10 years. 

In the last quarter of her sophomore year of High School, she joined ["KDVS" KDVS 90.3] and her life was then changed forever. People quickly noticed this naive high school student, with the uncharacteristic music she was playing on the air compared to the other youngsters who played the same old crap. 

Taking the time to dig through the stacks and a fondness for vinyl, other DJs began to notice and became like big brothers and sisters to her and that still remain like that to this day. Her incredible fondess for punk, post punk, garage, rock n roll, synth pop, synth punk, etc, and hours of reasearch and listening to records have build a datebase in her brain that should be found in 25-30 year olds, but instead are stored in this 18yr old. 

After almost 3 years at ["KDVS"], she is now on the Corestaff, still plays weird, obscure music but is currently taking a quarter break from her weekly radio program. 

In late 2004, she finally decided to take the plunge and start a record label/distro called [http://www.outoforderrecords.com Out of Order Records]

Finally finished with school, she can be found working in an Insurance office by day, and working in the basement by night. She can be seen at almost every Davis ["House Show" house show] and is usually up front due to her unfortunate height.
