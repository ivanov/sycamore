A must for any visitor and a weekly tradition for many residents, the Farmers Market at ["Central Park"] on '''4th and C Streets''' ["Downtown"] is open year-round, rain or shine.  Everything sold in the market is either grown by or made by the seller, including certified organic produce, fresh baked goods, flowers, and many other quality products.  Sample delicious fruit while mingling with vendors and neighbors.

The market is held:
  '''Saturdays from 8:00 AM until 1:00 PM''' year-round
  
  '''Wednesdays from 4:30 PM until 8:30 PM''' April through October (See also ["Picnic In The Park"])
  
  '''Wednesdays from 2:00 PM until 6:00 PM''' late October through March

While at the market, definitely treat yourself to a hot chicken tamale and a cold pint of '''''fantastic''''' fresh-pressed apple juice.

On summer evenings, the community enjoys a ["Picnic In The Park"] while listening to some good music.
