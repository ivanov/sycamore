J Street Apts. is located at 1111 J St., south of ["Cranbrook"] on the block between the intersections of 8th and Covell.  Amenities include a swimming pool, hot tub (both outdoor), small exercise room, pool table and ping-pong table (inside).  Accessories for the last two of these are frequently broken or missing but are usually replaced within a reasonable length of time.  Parking is abundant on the south end of the complex (left side if facing the complex from the street) and requires no registration or sticker.  Management personnel can often be seen riding around in a golf cart.

One downside is the train tracks just behind the complex, periodically a source of considerable noise.  Mailboxes are outside the north door of the clubhouse building which is nice for those times when they lock it up and you can't get in.  Rent for a 1-bedroom unit was $765/mo. for 2003-2004.  The ["Unitrans" E bus line] stops right in front of the complex and drops you off at the ["Memorial Union" MU] terminal.
