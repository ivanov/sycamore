Hunter S. Thompson jokingly offers this advice:

 You will not be able to see his eyes because of Tea-Shades, but his knuckles will be white from inner tension, and his pants will be crusted with semen from constantly jacking off when he can't find a rape victim.  He will stagger and babble when questioned.  He will not respect your authority.  The Dope Fiend fears nothing.  He will attack for no reason, with every weapon at his command -- including yours.  Beware.  Any officer apprehending a suspected marijuana addict should use all necessary force immediately.  One stitch in time -- on him -- will usually save nine -- on you.

   --Hunter S. Thompson, ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''
