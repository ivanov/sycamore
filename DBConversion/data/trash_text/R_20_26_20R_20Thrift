R & R Thrift is the thrift store complement to ["All Things Right And Relevant"], located just next door.  Like ["All Things Right And Relevant"], all profit goes to fund 11 mental health agencies in Yolo County. They also employ or provide employment for mental health clients and are constantly looking for volunteers(there are volunteer applications and training is provided for anyone looking to help out).
