Poor Yev.  Formerly known as "Happy Fuzz", the hamster Yev was adopted by ["MarieHuynh"] on November 7, 2004 from ["Petco"] and was the mascot for ["SOSSS"] and now ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"].  

For campaigning purposes, he is refered to as "Checkers." This is in reference to the semi-famous "Checkers Speech" of Prez. Nixon.

Yev was about 6 months old when the Petco people realized that he had a hole in his cheek where food was coming out when he tried to stuff his cheeks.  They took him to a vet who shaved and stitched him up.  Healthy but less fuzzy and with the ugly stitches on his cheek, they decided that nobody would want to buy him and stuck him in a 10 gallon tank beside a rat on a shelf under a bunch of stuff, labelled as "Happy Fuzz", up for adoption.

["MarieHuynh"] was looking for a gecko, but decided to take "Happy fuzz" home instead.  He was renamed Yevgeny The Tweak after Yevgeny Zamyatin, author of the book "We".

''What an awesome name.  (Says a Russian.)'' - ["MikeIvanov"]
