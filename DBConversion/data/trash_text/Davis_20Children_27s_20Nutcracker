The first production of the Davis Children's Nutcracker took place in 1977.  It was the brainstorm of ["Bob Bowen"], then head of ["Davis Parks and Recreation"], as a Christmas/Winter holiday activity for children.  It was advertised that everyone who auditioned would have a role in the show.  Seventy-five children auditioned and a tradition was born.  It was performed at the ["Veterans Memorial Theatre"]

The show is now up to 250 children participating, and inclusion is by lottery. The theater is not large enough to hold all the family members who want to come, so now they are even selling tickets to the dress rehearsal.

Eventually, there were too many children involved to take a photo of the entire cast on stage.

In 1980, tragedy struck The Davis Childrens' Nutcracker.  [http://www.sacbee.com/content/news/story/10892889p-11810497c.html Sabrina Gonsalves and John Riggins], who were part of the staff of that year's production, were kidnapped and ultimately murdered after attending a rehearsal.  The murder went unsolved until 2004.
