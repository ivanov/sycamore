According to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technophobia Wikipedia] "technophobia is the fear of modern technology." This means people who fear using computers, cell phones, or various other modern instruments have are all to certain degrees technophobes.

An example, ''["GarySaylin"], who adds books to the ["Shields Library"] for a living, once said that he believes computers are just a phase. This means Gary is certainly a technophobe.''

["ArlenAbraham"] does not own a cell phone and probably never will. He strongly encourages you to join the anti-cellphone leauge.
