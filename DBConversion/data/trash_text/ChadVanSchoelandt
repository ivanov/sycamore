''RevChad, please stop running around the wiki implying that I dislike the Gender and Sexuality Commission, or that in particular I dislike the commissioner. Love your neighbor as yourself (Leviticus 19:18) -- even if you disagree, and don't go about as a talebarer among your people (Leviticus 19:16). So don't think you know what I think about her or her commission. -- ["KenBloom"].''

''Hey folks, it looks like a WWW: a ''Wiki Wiki War'', starring the Orwellian in one corner and the Republican in the other.  Who will win?  Anyone want to start a pool?'' -- ["BrentLaabs"]

''This wouldn't be the first WWW, but it could be more interesting than those in the past, we can call it WWII. So for the record Ken what is your opinion of GASC and it's fearless leader?'' --["DanMasiel"]

''Chad plans to remove this discussion in a few days, but wants to give Ken a chance to answer first. I have only see him criticize GASC, but if he wishes to say otherwise I would love to read it.'' --["RevChad"]

''Why was I the only one to laugh at ["RevChad"]'s proposed program at the GASC meeting?. I'm seriously looking forward to this fight against Ken and Chad. THis should be uber funny." --["GeorgejAndrews"]
