[http://www.thai-nakorn.com/ Thai Nakorn] is a welcome addition to Davis' already good choices in Thai restaurants. It seems almost always full. Favorite vegetarian dishes include vegetable Tom Yum and eggplant with tofu. A carnivore friend is very fond of the duck curry. Great place to eat before hitting the Signature Stadium for a show.
