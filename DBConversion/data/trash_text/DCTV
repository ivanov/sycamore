I don't know the exact history of Davis Community Television. The next time I visit the station, I will try to get those details.
The link below the station's website link describe internship opportunities at Davis Community Television. If you are interested in any aspect of television production, editing, program development, I reccommend that you apply for an intership. 

Internships are offered every quarter and can last from 3-6 months depending on what you want to learn. There is a studio internship and a field internship in which you learn about cameras and film projects outside the studio. Jeff Shaw, the coordinator is really awesome and was one of the guiding forces behind KDRT 101.5 FM, the new low power community radio station. - J.C.
