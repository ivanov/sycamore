The [http://telperion.info Order of Telperion] is a mystical knighthood, based in Davis and not at all connected to the local fraternity called ["Alpha Gamma Omega"] All that is done by the Order is secret, except for that which is ''not'' secret; regardless, all is done in the "appropriate manner," which, incidentally, ''is'' secret. Sorry. None of Telperion's members have ever been a part of ["Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion"] and ''certainly'' do '''not''' recomend that you "Steal ["Bainer Hall" this] Building."
