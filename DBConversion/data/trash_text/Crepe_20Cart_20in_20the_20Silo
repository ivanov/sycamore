This place is great if you want a crêpe from a REAL Frenchman!  (The owner is from France) 
I ''personally'' prefer the crêpe cart (also referred to by its formal name "La Crêpe") to ["Crepeville"] any day...but hey, thats just me. Now, for the details!

First of all, you can choose a "Breakfast Crêpe," a "Daily Specials" crêpe, a "Make Your Own" crêpe, or a "Dessert Crêpe"! (exciting isn't it?)

= Breakfast Crêpes =
For Those who want a "Breakfast Crêpe" the following choices are available:
  *Sugar and Butter
  *Sugar and Cinnamon
  *Maple Crêpe - plain crêpe with Vermont maple syrup.
  *L'omelette Crêpe - these come with three eggs, salt, pepper, and cream.  For an additional charge per addition (depending on which you choose), You also get your choice of:
     *cheese
     *cheese and mushrooms
     *cheese and spinich
     *cheese, pesto, and tomatoes
     *cheese and ham
     *cheese, ham, and mushrooms (and you can substitute ''bacon'' on any order with ''ham'')
  *Piperade - this vegetarian crêpe is an omelette over ratatuoille(veggies) and cheese, wrapped in, you guessed it, a crêpe. For a decription of "ratatuoille" look under the "Daily Specials" section.

= Daily Specials =
Now, for that eager student who would like to try one of the delicious "Daily Specials"...you are in for a treat!  Enjoying your savory crêpe is easy!  All you have to do is choose from "white flour" or "wheat flour".  
Cheese comes in ALL the savory crêpes, so you get your choice of either Jack, Swiss, or Cheddar cheese. :) YUM.  
There are also three sauces available with these savory crêpes.  They are: Mornay*, Curry*, and Pesto.  The first two are free of charge, but be warned!  Pesto costs extra! 
So, anyway...back to the yummy.  Next, you pick your crêpe, and there is ''quite'' the selection!
  *Fromage Classic - cheese wrapped in a crêpe.
  *Crêpe à la Tomate - sliced roma tomatoes over a bed of cheese.
  *Crêpe with Mushrooms - mushrooms over a bed of cheese.
  *Spinich OR Broccoli & Cheese - self-explanatory.  ask for their yummy mornay sauce with this one; it complements the crêpe nicely.
  *Ze Ham Classic - ham and cheese.
  *Spinich OR Broccoli & Mushroom - comes with cheese also.  ask for the mornay sauce on this one too!
  * Gaetano Pesto Crêpe - tomatoes and cheese with Pesto.
  *Ham, Mushrooms, and Cheese - self explanatory as well.  you can ask for mornay on this one as well.
  *Spinich OR Broccoli & Ham - you know the drill.  it comes with cheese, and mornay is nummy on it! :)
  *Ratatouille - A vegetable stew of bell peppers, zucchini, tomatoes, onions, garlic, and spices with your choice of cheese.  
     *Haters of onions and/or bell peppers BEWARE!!! this crêpe contains them...and the staff probably won't pick them out for you. :( 
  *Coq au Vin (loosely pronounced "coke oh van")- chicken and mushrooms covered in a homemade white wine mornay sauce, with your choice of cheese. (YUM CITY!  my 2nd Favorite)
  *Kathmandu (loosely pronounced "Cat-man-doo")- chicken, mushrooms, and your choice of cheese, covered in a curry sauce, and served with a dollop of mango chutney. (this is my ''FAVORITE'' crêpe!)
  *Fiesta - mushrooms, tomatoes, olives, and your choice of cheese, topped with sour cream and salsa.
  *Acropolis - tomatoes, artichoke hearts, and olives over feta cheese! this is their "greek inspiration".
  *Spinich OR Broccoli, Ham & Mushrooms - again.  self-explanatory.  comes with cheese, and ask for the mornay cus its good with this crêpe.
  *Alain's Avocado - tomatoes, mushrooms, and half an avacado, with your choice of cheese.
  *Florentine - this is basically, the Coq au Vin with spinich as well.
  *Poulet Provencal - ratatouille, chicken breast, and cheese covered in mornay sauce.
  *Beef Bourguignon - tender beef chunks and carrots cooked in a red wine sauce, with your choice of cheese.
  *Le Duo - this is basically the Beef Bourguignon with ratatouille.

ALSO!  *Note for the Vegetarians in da house: both the Mornay and Curry sauces contain chicken broth.  just FYI!

= Make Your Own Crêpe =
Finally, there are a variety of choices available for the hungry student who wishes to create his/her own perfect crêpe.  There are 2 easy steps.
1. Start with a plain crêpe. (White or wheat flour)
2. Pick the fillings...each filling has its own price; pay attention before you add $10 worth of fillings!  Also, make sure that each thing you pick complements each other, or just be aware if they dont.
  *Cheese (they suggest it!)- jack, swiss, cheddar, feta
  *Meats - ham, bacon, chicken, 3-egg omelette, beef bourguignon (which is significantly more expensive than ALL the other meats)
  *Veggies - tomatoes, mushrooms, spinich, broccoli, avocado, artichoke hearts, olives, ratatouille, parsley(free), onions(free)
  *Sauces - pesto, mornay(free), curry(free)

And now for the...
= Dessert Crêpes =
All the dessert crêpes are topped with powdered sugar and can be topped with whipped cream if you request it! You can also add Chocolate or Nutella for an additional cost.
  *Lemon Crêpe - freshly squeezed lemon, sugar, and butter
  *Preserve Crêpe - your choice of either apricot, strawberry, orange marmalade, or raspberry preserves
  *Chocolate Dream - semi-sweet chocolate wrapped in a plain crêpe.
  *Nutella Crêpe - the infamous hazelnut and chocolate spread in sinful amounts (Nutella is SOOO good, and addictive...)
  *Crêpe Suzette - orange Marmalade spread on a crêpe and topped with Grand Marnier!  bien sur!

La Crêpe also has a seasonal strawberry selection for their dessert crêpes. these are:

  *Strawberry and Bananas

So anyway, i hope my little (BIG) menu helps you with all your crêpe selection needs!  As the take-away menu says, "Merci et bon appetit!" -["JulieLujano"]


A bit expensive for breakfast, but the people are nice and the food isn't bad.  Try an ["Orangina"] while you're there.  

''I recommend the Florentine or the Coq au Vin crepes. Or, if you prefer, any of the omelette ones are good.'' - ["AndreyGoder"]

''My fav Crêpe place in Davis, IMO better than ["Crepeville"] or even the now defunct Crepe Bistro.  Spinach and/or broccoli and/or mushrooms crêpes with swiss cheese and mornay sauce were my favorites.'' - ["JevanGray"]

[[BR]]''I recently tried Bacon, Jack, Avocado, and Mornay Sauce - YUM! But I miss the cool guys behind the counter :-('' - ["LizaAbeja"]
