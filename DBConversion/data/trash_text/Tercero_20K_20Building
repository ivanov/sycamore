''K building used to have a "special K" logo painted in it.  but at the end of our freshman year living there (2002) they painted over it because of the drug reference.  they also got rid of the "doobie brothers" painted on the bottom floor wall.'' -["LauraCochrane"]
 * ''Note: The special K logo is actually still there today.'' -["JoeySammut"]
