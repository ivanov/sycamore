= The ASUCD Court =
As the ASUCD Constitution phrases it: "The judicial authority of the ["ASUCD"] shall be vested in one ASUCD Court ...and the ["Student Judicial Affairs"]/["Campus Judicial Board"]."  The latter only deals with elections issues.

The ASUCD Court consists of nine members, nominated by the ASUCD President and confirmed by the Senate.  The Chief Justice is chosen from among these by the same process.  Justices serve until they graduate, resign, or, more likely, are removed by the Senate and exiled to the ["ASUCD Gulag"] the Siberia.  Justices may be permanently removed by a 2/3rds vote of the Senate after a personnel hearing on the matter - incidently there is no similar mechanism for impeachment of senators.  In fall of 2003, there were three removal attempts against Court members.

If one feels that an ASUCD officer is not conducting their job correctly, or ASUCD legislation is not consistance with existent ASUCD bylaws, or other similar claim, they may file a complaint with ["SGAO"], who shall have on hand a complaint form (in the past they've sometimes claimed not to have one, in which case one should just answer the questions found in Section 402(2) of the [http://asucd.ucdavis.edu/gov/docs/ Judicial Codes]).  SGAO should get it to the Court and you'll hear from the Court with further instructions when they've decided whether or not to take the case.
The Court meets at 8pm on Tuesdays in the ASUCD Conference Room, 3rd Floor ["MU"] during this the Fall quarter of 2004.  It is subject to change every quarter however.

[[TableOfContents]]

= Membership =
The Court currently consists of:
 * Chief Justice ["KrisFricke" Kris Fricke]
 * Alternate Presiding Justice Daniel Raff
 * Justice Anthony Middleton
 * Justice Jeremy Johnson
 * Justice Katie Konz
 * Justice Hafez Shahabi
 * Justice Connie Zheng
 * Justice Ruwan Ekanayake
 * Justice Michael Matthews

Kris Fricke has been the Chief Justice for about two years now.  He led a coup d'etat shortly after being put on the court and was installed as Chief Justice while still the newest Court member, having sat on the Court for about a month, dissented on every opinion, and been the plaintiff in the first three cases to be considered (which had been filed during the previous year but the Court wasn't operational for the preceding entire year).

Justices Middleton and Johnson have been on the Court longer than anyone can recall, but it is believed they were Bledsoe appointees in winter 2002.  Soon they will both have hit the four year mark on Court tenure.

Other than the Chief Justice & Alt, the above lists Justices in descending order of time on the Court, and alphabetically where simulteniously appointed (to the best of this author's memory).  The Alternate Presiding Justice, as one can imagine, presides in the absense of the Chief Justice.  They are elected quarterly.  Daniel Raff was elected unanymously for his first term in this position this Fall.


= Identity Crisis =
In 2001 a Constitutional Amendment was passed changing the name of the principal judicial organ of ASUCD from "ASUCD Supreme Court" to "ASUCD Court."  In the copies of the Constitution and bylaws produced by SGAO, the change was rendered to "Student Court," and in an overzealous rampage of derision, they proceeded to change every instance of "Justice" to "Member," and "Chief Justice" to "Chairperson," among other things.

After thorough discussion of the subject, the Court has decided that the references to "Student Court" etc, having never been legally rendered, are erronious and that this constitutes a continuing erronious behaviour until it is changed in the copies that the SGAO is producing.  As of this writing, the error has not been fixed.

As such, the Court will continue to permit the informal reference to itself as "Student Court," but finds that it is in fact legally the "ASUCD Court."  As the ASUCD Court is the highest authority for interpretation of the codes within ASUCD, the Court's finding is law.

= History =
The pre-history of the Court is shrouded in myths and legends as record keeping in ASUCD seems to be shockingly bad.  In fact, though some recent Opinions have been submitted to ["SGAO"] multiple times as word documents, and they even printed them out and posted them, they still profess not to have them on record anymore.

Legend has it, that the ASUCD Court was created in its recognizable form in 1994 as the Supreme Court, with an Inferior Court as well, which was never used.  In the first seven years there were allegedly eight cases, five of which were in 1995 regarding elections issues.  (source: Background on Constitutional Amendment 1 of 2001)

In 2001 the ASUCD Supreme Court disqualified the Bledsoe/Beaman executive ticket of the ["LEAD" Lead] party for "massive cheating worse than Ukraine in 2004" (they were very prescient back then).  Bledsoe, self proclaimed "["Black Caesar" Black Caesar of ASUCD]", then threatened to sue ASUCD, the Court, the Administration, and anyone else remotely involved back into the stone age.  Under threat of this impending legal holocaust, the Court reversed its ruling and allowed "the Reverend" Tiqula Bledsoe to take office.  Like the Romans razing Carthage to the ground and salting its former soil, Bledsoe Maximus wanted to triumphantly squash his nemisis the judiciary, and had its name changed legally to the ASUCD Court, and extralegally to Student Court, with Chairpersons and Members (see Identity Crisis, above).  Also, and very significantly, all matters relating to Elections were removed from the Court's jurisdiction.  Having succeeded in this he then treated himself to the spoils of ASUCD, using government funds to pay for limos and parking tickets (not an exaggeration).

There followed a year during which the Court was so crushed that it did not even meet.  Cases were filed (by ["Lamar Heystek"], and ["KrisFricke" Kris Fricke] among others), but the plaintiffs in many cases never heard back from the Court once the complaint was filed.  When the Court resumed activity with the D1 Case, it was designated Case # 19; obviously this doesn't add up to the eight cases previously mentioned, unless ten were filed during the year of inactivity.  Hence I emphasize, the history of the Court really is somewhat a matter of myth and legend.

In the winter of 2002, the Court had a major case regarding the move to D1.  It hinged upon a misprint in the Codes that led to confusion as to whether or not the referendum to place the ["Move to D1"] question on the ballot.  The majority of the Court found that the referendum had indeed been placed incorrectly on the ballot and declared it therefore null and void.  Newly appointed Justice ["KrisFricke" Kris Fricke] was the sole dissenter, claiming that yes there was clearly a mistake in the process through which the referendum ended up on the ballot, but the Court did not have jurisdiction over elections and should have handed the case back to the elections committee once it had examined and interpreted the contested codes.  In response to this declaration, the ASUCD Executive Office stated "we believe [the Court] is only advisory" (obviously they had skipped over the part in the Constitution which mentions ''binding opinions'').  The Court subsequently met with the UC Davis legal council, who informed them that Justice Kris Fricke was in fact correct and they were fairly far from the recognized path of legal norms.  Within a month the previous Chief Justice resigned, and Justice Fricke was confirmed as the new Chief Justice just in time to swear in a new executive office.

Under the Fricke Administration, the Court considered six cases the following year.  This year (2004/2005) the Court has not yet had any cases filed, but is keeping itself thoroughly occupied with judicial reforms.

= Official Opinions =
Many cases appear to be lost to the sands of time, as ["SGAO"] tends to missplace them and Chief Justice Fricke's computer crashed at the beginning of Fall 2003 and lost all court documents on it previous to that.[[BR]]
The availability of opinions is important however.  Reading them, one can understand what kind of things constitute a case, and more importantly, the Court would probably be very impressed if someone cited precedent from a previous ASUCD case in arguing a future one.   

These documents are not copyrighted (government documents cannot be copyrighted.  This applies to ASUCD documents when ASUCD is acting as a government, and don't let them tell you otherwise), but of course disseminating an altered & misleading version of one of these would be illegal.  Official copies of these may be (officially should be) available at the ["SGAO"] office on the 3rd floor of the ["MU"]

'''Case # 24''' - Spring 2004 - Michael Siminitus v ["Mark Champagne"].  Eventually dismissed after a special hearing on jurisdiction.  ''Its a really interesting case, I thought there was a formal document detailing our finding from the special hearing, but I'm not seeing it.'' -["KrisFricke" KF][[BR]]
'''Case # 25''' - Spring 2004 - Filed a day after the above, it involved essentially the same Plaintiffs and Defendants.
