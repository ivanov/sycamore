Student Focus isn't an acronym. It is one of the stronger political parties on campus when it comes to the ["ASUCD"] ["Senate"] elections. ["Fraternities" Frats] and sororities are commonly associated with Student Focus candidates.

They used to have a website...but its gone.

Student Focus currently controls 50% of the ["Senate"] because of the president's power to appoint senators to fill spots in cases of resignation, as well as the executive branch under ["Kalen Gallagher" Kalen Gallagher's] presidency.

This ["Slate" slate] got a lot of flack about ["Campaigning in Dorms Controversy" breaking the election rules] during the elections of Fall 2004, and this contributed to the resignation of two of the winning senators.

Student Focus grew from an alliance of ["Student Action"] and ["Unite"], which fell out of power when ["L.E.A.D."] came to prominence.  Their current opponents are ["L.E.A.D."] and ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"].
