There is a pool, spa, weight room, and a common laundry room.  If you go to the laundry room, watch out for the dryer with the X scratched into the top of the door, as with some larger loads of laundry it wont dry them at all.  Every Friday morning be prepared to wake up to the sounds of the landscaping crew.  These apartments all have sliding glass front doors, which is not convenient or cool.  Some apartments have a sliding glass door as their main entry, while others just have one for "convenience".  They also have very few windows and a damp cave like atmosphere.  The built in lights on the inside are very minimal.  However, the management is very friendly and they make repairs promptly, often without charging.  There are occasional parties in Chautauqua, but they rarely get out of hand or obnoxious.  Most neighbors are friendly enough to let you know if they plan on having one so you can prepare.  Chautauqua is a part of ["Tandem Properties"].
