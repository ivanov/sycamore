Dance Dance Revolution is a game in which you jump up and down (or "dance") on a bunch of squares with arrows on them that point away from the center square.  Listen to the music and watch the screen.  When the arrows match up, step on the corresponding arrow on the floor. 

Some find it silly.  Some find it curiously addicting.

The only coin-operated machine in Davis is located in ["Tapioca Express"] on E Street downtown.  There's also a DDR Extreme machine in ["Woodland"].  If you need to dance but don't feel like going that far, you can also try ["Pump it Up"] in the MU Games Area.
