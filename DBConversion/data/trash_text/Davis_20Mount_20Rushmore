The Davis Mount Rushmore or Mount Rushmore of Davis, however you want to say it, was a phrase coined by ["GarrettPierce"] to describe people who have reached a stature in ["Davis"] that transcends many of the boundaries of ["Social Structures"]. Simply put, they are ''famous in Davis,'' and not just in the categories of ["Bros"], ["Scenesters"], or ["Mature Davisites"]. The Mount Rushmore are known as people not just as a public personas, like those in the ["Town Characters"] section.

''Who is on your Davis Mount Rushmore?''

 * ["BenDuax"] - Ben is just a teenager, but he has a radio show on ["KDVS"] since the late 1990s. He is popular with the ["Scenesters"] and is known by townies and college students. Any Communications major at UC Davis who has taken a course from Paul Duax has surely heard stories about Ben from his father.

 * ["Shelly Bailes and Ellen Pontac"] - Davis' "poster children" for gay rights.
