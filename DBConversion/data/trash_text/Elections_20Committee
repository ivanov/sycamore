The "ASUCD Elections Committee" administers the election process in ["ASUCD"].

The [http://asucd.ucdavis.edu official ASUCD webpage] has this to say about the Elections Committee:

''The elections committee ensures the smooth and fair administration of ASUCD elections. The committee also coordinates publicity to encourage students to vote and puts on candidate and ballot measure forums to better inform students of election issues.

Two general elections are held each academic year. Six senators are elected on the seventh week of fall quarter and six senators and the President and Vice President are elected during the seventh week of winter quarter.

The Elections Committee hires up to sixty pollworkers for the day of the election. Students interested in working as a pollworker should inquire at the ASUCD job board located on the 3rd floor of the MU.''

Current members are:
  * '''Chair''' Christine Schachter
  * '''Events Coordinator''' Renee Ashbaugh
  * '''Media Coordinator''' Sallie Boorman
  * '''Outreach Coordinator''' Jacob Cutler
  * '''Publicity Coordinator''' Jamie Phelps
  * '''Advisor''' ["Vicki Swett"]


Incidently the Elections Committee are distinctly set outside the jurisdiction of the ["ASUCD Court"].  Cases of elections-rule violations by candidates are decided by the Elections Committee, and can be appealed to Student Judicial Affair; any other matter relating to the elections committee is in NO jurisdiction.

= Proposed Reforms =
Rampant controversy subsequent to the fall 2004 elections (see Media Coverage, below) has lead to a number of proposed reforms for the elections committee.

Though this document is only a rough draft, it details some of the allegations raised in this election and the reasons for reform.  The committee is reviewing the proposals and researching ways to make clear and enforcible regulations.
