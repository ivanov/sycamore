[http://picnicday.ucdavis.edu Picnic Day] is the day every April when anybody who has ever lived in Davis or attended UC Davis--EVER--comes back to town and wanders around ["Campus"] and ["Downtown"]. There's a giant parade in the morning and events and exhibitions all over the place. Two of the most important are, of course, the ["Doxie Derby"] and the ["Picnic Day Battle Of The Bands" Battle of the Bands]. The event is co-sponsored by both the City of Davis and the university.
