It's not certain why the treehouse is called the treehouse.  It's actually a two-story house, with the second story just added as an afterthought on top of the garage--accessible only from the outside.  So one interpretation would be that the treehouse has this name because of the second story's resemblance to a treehouse with its big "fort-like" balcony.  But alternatively, it might refer to the whole house because there's lots of citrus, pomegranate and other trees surrounding the house which has a communal back yard.  It's very umm.. rustic.

Picture forthcoming.
