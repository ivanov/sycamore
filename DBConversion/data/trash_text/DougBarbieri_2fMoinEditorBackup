This page is a list of things Davis sorely lacks.  Businesses will, of course, take note of our suggestions.

= Restaurants =
== 24-Hour Los Angeles-Style Mexican Restaruant ==
 * LA-style restaurants do not use excessive "filling" (e.g., lettuce, beans, rice) in their burritos.  Take for example the famous [http://www.albertosmexicanfoods.com/menu.htm Alberto's] mom-and-pop chain (each store individually owned).  Their Carne Asada burrito is a model for all Taco Shop aspirants to follow.  AND they're 24-hour.  Where's the 24-hour authentic mexican food?  - ["JaimeRaba"]
    * I don't think of 24-hour restaurants when I think authentic mexican food.  And I didn't know they had a 24 hour fitness around here... - ["MarieHuynh"]
      * "Mom & Pop" mexican fast-food joints in ["SoCal"] are often open 24-hours. - ["JeyKottalam"]
      * Yeah, totally.  And the 24-hour fitness is basically next to Sudwerk, although on 2nd Street. - ["JaimeRaba"]

== Authentic Italian Food ==
 * Authentic Italian Food - While Davis lacks restaurants in a general capacity, there seems to be a complete lack of '''good''' Italian food.  Pizza is not a substitute for a real Italian restaurant. - ["BrandonKeene"]
 * While I think Original Pete's and Cafe Italia to do a decent job, I don't think they're quite up to North Beach standards.  Could Davis support a true Italian restaurant?  I bet it could.

== Dim Sum ==
 * Dim Sum!  There's enough chinese people around aren't there?  Why don't they stop doing Japanese food and start selling some real chinese food?

= Shopping = 
== Target ==
 * Target - Apparently there are some tentative plans for the city to consider allowing a Target by ["24 Hour Fitness"]. I could use a target right now.  People need their resonably priced tube socks, towels, toothpaste, deoderant, etc. - ["JaimeRaba"]
   * I don't want a big box store in Davis. It kills the whole idea of being a "small town". - ["RaynatoCastro"]
   * Well, ever since they put in Cost Plus, that whole idea is out the door.  And plus a Target out by 24-hour would be an area that would not be in the middle of town.  And also, Davis is not actually small.  It has too few stores to serve its population that exceeds 50,000. - ["JaimeRaba"]
     * While ["Cost Plus World Market" Cost Plus] is a chain, they pander to the inner-["Yuppies" yuppie] in us all. Target is where poor people shop, shesh. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
     * what do you mean davis has too few stores to serve its population?  People have enough crap as it is. - ["MarieHuynh"]
  * People have to drive (burning fuel) to Woodland, Sacramento or Vacaville to obtain things that people need on a daily basis at a reasonable price.  It is in fact what people do, so why not spare the air and put in some establishments that will keep tax revenues in our cash-strapped county? - ["JaimeRaba"]
    * BAHAHAHAHAHAHA...  the truly cash strapped should stop wasting money on the car and BIKE more often.  Then they'll have more money to buy stuff they really need.  Anyone who can afford a car can afford the basic necessities.  Target has a lot of JUNK.  Those are not necessary to keep one alive.  We have stores that sell food and they usually have other basic things people need.  I have no car and do not go to Target but am still alive and well.  Let those that can afford extra junk go the little bit of extra distance.  Besides, Yolo county includes Woodland and West Sac  - ["MarieHuynh"]
    * No.  See, by cash strapped county, I mean Yolo county has difficulty providing social services because it has a big population and not a big tax base.  So they raise money primarily through taxing business.  I think Prop 13 also negatively impacts this, because it sort of takes property taxes out of the mix.  So, West Sacramento and Woodland's increasing amount of industrial complexes do provide somewhat of a tax basis, but then again they also have a lion's share of financial need.  And one thing that is absolutely clear is that Davis students ALREADY go outside the county for their major purchases.  So instead of spending money in Davis at the places openly criticized as being too expensive, they go elsewhere.  And these are places you cannot bike to.  Davis ALREADY has a big set of box stores that nobody really thinks of.  In addition to the Cost Plus that mars the dorm-centric area of Davis, Davis also has several "box" car dealerships and "box" gyms and "box" auto repair shops.  I think if one of these boxes (preferably in the mace/chiles area) held a store that would be more profitable to the inhabitants of Davis in terms of tax revenue and maybe actually giving them some value-priced merchandice, it would beneficial to all.  
    * When I think of major purchases, I think of computers, cars, and houses.  I'd rather not have people buy lots of crap here or anywhere else, period.  We don't NEED it.  I don't care if it's cheap.  And I really don't understand why students go and pay for memberships to gyms when they have a brand spanking new ARC.    - ["MarieHuynh"] 
    * People need food, soap, shampoo, toothpaste, clothing, etc.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's what I'm talking about.  And they waste tons of money buying it in Davis.  In fact, I think the reason why students eat out so much, is because the supermarkets' mark-ups are so high.  And if you need to buy a can opener?  What do you do?  You buy it at a 1000% markup at Safeway or Riteaid.  It's not good.  As far as gym membership, I think it's mostly people who don't have access to the ARC, or those who need 24-hour gym acess.  Hey, you didn't even know there ''was'' a 24-Hour Fitness!  - ["JaimeRaba" jr] 

== Trader Joe's ==
 * Trader Joe's would be a nice thing to have.  they have lots of reasonably priced wine, and they have the best prepackaged tomato roasted red pepper soup... yum. - ["LauraCochrane"]
    * Trader Joe's would not be nice in Davis. We have our own local store that sells similar things that Tader Joe's does. It is called ["The Co-Op"]. Why would you want your town be like every other?  - ["RobRoy"]
    * I think the co-op would continue to make Davis unique, even if it had a Trader Joe's.  But then again, lots of other towns have Co-ops.  Take Sacramento's co-op, for example-- it's a bit nicer in many respects, yet the prices are lower and the organic selection is bigger.   I think a little healthy competition would help the co-op out a little bit.  That's been the case in Sacramento.  I think the Davis Co-op is a little set in its ways and in its state of cleanliness.  If you ever read the co-op newsletter, I'm a little confounded with their fairly frequent dismissals of very good ideas and recommendations.  But I re-main pro-co-op.  I'm just not anti-Trader Joe's.  I think a good spot for a TJ's would be out around Mace/Chiles. - ["JaimeRaba" jr]
   * Sorry, but I personally really want Trader Joe's here. They have stuff that you just can't get at the Co-Op--for example, "Two-buck Chuck." Not to mention their wonderful assortments of import foods, etc. Trader Joe's would add so much to this town. - ["DougBarbieri" rdb]

= Coffee late at night =
 * I know this is a pipe dream, but I'd love to have a place in Davis where I could get coffee at practically any hour (that isn't AMPM).  It was so nice when ["Cafe Roma"] stayed open for 24 during that one finals week -- oh, such a taste of what was possible!  I hear that it isn't worth it to keep a coffee shop open that late at night, and it's likely not, but it'd still be cool to have a place to get coffee. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
  * Ahh, such a sweet, sad dream. Coffee at night. It's pathetic that a college town of this size can't support an all night coffee shop. When I'm up at 4 am and need coffee and a quiet place to study, I have to go to Dixon, which can be a real pain when I only have my bike available. How can Davis have 25K students, and not enough late nighters to make it worthwhile? What is wrong with everyone? Ok, I think I'm done ranting, but I too dream of a 24-hour Roma. - ["EricKlein"]
  * I would waaaay make use of an all night cafe (especially one with free wireless Internet). - ["DougBarbieri"]

= Real Asian supermarket =
 * Davis needs a real Asian food store, like the ones you find on Stockton Blvd in Sac. If there are enough Asians here to support the Old Teahouse, there's enough to support such a store.  Cheap fresh seafood, cheap shitake mushrooms, chili sauces...drool...speaking of which, Davis also needs a gay dance club because you can't dance in coffee shops - ["GaryMa"]
    * Gary, have you been to that Korean place next to ["Silver Dragon"]? - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
    * Yeah, but that place's selection is actually inferior to the former Harvest Market.  And the prices are EXTREMELY high.  The Asian markets on Stockton Blvd and also Broadway are BIG stores that are full service.  I'd be all for a true Asian super-market.  There used to be a Ralph's near 8th and L streets, and it's a supermarket that is _completely_ empty.  This would be perfect for an Asian store. - ["JaimeRaba" jr]
