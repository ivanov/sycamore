=  Overview =
DRAGON, which stands for Davis Roleplaying Activities and Gaming Organizational Network, meets Friday nights on the top floor of ["Wellman Hall"] on ["Campus"].  Meetings "start" at 5 PM but most people are usually there by 6:15.  In general, people tend to play collectable card games (CCG) and board games in the early hours and role-playing games in the later hours, but there are always exceptions.

They maintain an [http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/DRAGON_gamers/ email list] at Yahoo groups.


= Culture =
If you want to meet a bunch of strange geeky guys and the (half dozen or so) chicks that like to play ["Roleplaying games" games], feel free to wander into the main meeting room near the middle of the floor.  Joe gives out free popcorn provides  pizza at buck a slice + free soda.

DRAGON is different from other clubs, as they first meet up in DRAGON Main Room in the center of the building, but then proceed to run games in other rooms.  Each RPG, CCG, or even CRPG can have its own room, which really helps games move along.  After all, each game is truly a different world.

Every Halloween, DRAGON has a Scavenger Hunt.  Items from the 2004 Hunt included:
 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu C'thulhu] (1 point)
 * One of the things found [http://www.weebls-stuff.com/data/toons/kenya3.swf Only in Kenya] (2 points)
 * The Sun (1 point)
 * Any ["Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion" CCCC] flyer (1 point per, no duplicates)
 * A member of the ["Students for an Orwellian Society" Orwellian Society] (2 points)
 * My (Kat's) Sanity (10 points)

= Games =
Among CCGs, Magic: The Gathering and Legend of the Five Rings are the most commonly played.  Particpants also tend to bring games such as Illuminati, Chez Geek, and Fluxx.  Board games are also common, but tend to be geek games like Settlers of Cataan -- take that Monopoly!  Often, someone brings their console games to play on the projectors of Wellman Hall classrooms.

RPG games are really the core of DRAGON, and most people in the club participate in one of the games.  The longest running is a truly bizzare Alternity game run by Dimitri Horaites for over 4 years.  There are also games playing Champions, GURPS, Hackmaster, or plain vanilla D&D.  Tyler Barrell is usually playtesting a new game, most recently Dead Stars and Assassins.  Games run either every week or every other week, excluding holidays and finals.

In addition, there's a LARP (live action role-playing) game running concurrently in ["The Pit"] called [http://www.dreamersball.com/ Dreamer's Ball], but the people upstairs don't see them much.
