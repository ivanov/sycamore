This is an energetic ["Chinese Food" Chinese] restaurant.  It's open late, serves ["tapioca drinks"] and draws in lots of students from the dorms.  

There are three TVs dangerously close to one another, positioned on the same wall.  There is a fourth (on another wall) just for good measure.  Of the three TVs, one is a widescreen--at least one of them always stretches people out in one direction or another.  These TV are usually used to play Asian-language music videos, generally on DVD/VCD.  They sometimes play foreign language films, mostly Cantonese, the occassional Mandarin and even rarer Korean film has been spotted.  This is very amusing. They also have HK magazines in a stack near the entrance, that are amusing to flip through.

''It used to be that The Old Teahouse had the worst tea but the best tapioca.  Then the quality of their tea improved dramatically.  But nowadays they are often out of tapioca when I come in, so I stick with ["Tapioca Express"].  Unless I'm really hungry.'' - ["MikeIvanov"]

''They have really good fried rice. Not a lot of ["Vegetarian Options" vegetarian selections] though, so I had to special-order it without meat. I haven't tried a lot of their other food, but be aware, they don't serve food around an hour before they close. Or you have to wait really long for your order. I also like their jasmine green tea. I order it with tapioca because recently their tapioca had changed--it is a weird colorful texture now.'' - ["YawenChen"]

''Until I visted Old Teahouse, I used to say that ["Tapioca Express" TapEx] had better tea, and ["The Posh Bagel" Pork Bagel] had better tapioca pearls.  But neither holds a candle to Old Teahouse for several reasons.  First, you can get a huge cup of really good tea for a good price.  Second, the pearls are nice and chewy.  And finally (and most important), the ratios are right so that you finish your tea and pearls at the same time and you aren't left with a sealed cup of ice the way ["Tapioca Express" TapEx] often winds up.'' -- ["JabberWokky" jw]

''Their tea is great/cheap but food prices are somewhat ridiculous (although i suppose u get what you pay for.) A 7$ beef chow fun, lol.'' -["DerekTam" dtam]

''Random tidbit: The store logo features the characters ''&#21476;&#33590;&#22825;'', which as far as I know means something along the lines of "Old Tea Heaven," rather than "Old Teahouse" as you'd expect. (Please feel free to yell at me if this is incorrect)'' - ["AmitVainsencher" AV]
