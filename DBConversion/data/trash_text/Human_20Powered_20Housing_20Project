I'd like to add more information here, since this guy is pretty nice and hangs out around ["The Co-Op"] with his Bike RV contraption. I'll snag a pic with my digi if I get the chance.

["Brian"] owns and lives in the contraption.

''I've heard tell that he rents out rooms for $5/night. That's probably less than what you're paying for rent. Somebody ask him if they see him before me.''- ["ArlenAbraham" aa]
