== Introduction ==
As the sole ["Davis Politics" politically vocal] conservative group at UC Davis, it is the responsibility of the Davis College Republicans (DCR) to present the “other side” on our college campus. The DCR call to duty is: “add to the ‘diversity of opinions’ because if we don’t do it, who will?” The determination to establish a solid conservative presence on this campus has made DCR one of the most successful campus clubs.  DCR membership ballooned to over 800 in the 2003-04 school year, making it one of the largest clubs on campus. It is also currently the largest College Republican chapter in the state of California.

DCR has served as a successful stepping-stone for many members into the field of politics. The current occupations alumni range from Campaign Managers for targeted (real) Assembly and Senate Races to Legislative Directors for Congressmen. It serves as a very valuable asset to the California Republican Party through the various objectives of the club: ranging from providing training resources new members to assisting with grassroots Republican efforts.

DCR guest speakers in 2004 have included Stockton Mayor ["Gary Podesto"], Father of the Recall & UCD Alumni ["Ted Costa"] and State Senator ["Rico Oller"] (R-San Andreas)
