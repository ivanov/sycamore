Dead Zone is a head shop -- the only one in Davis.  They sell a variety of goods including blacklight posters, incense, clothing, body jewelry, tobacco accessories, and water pipes.

Please have your ID ready, the guy at the counter cards you if you appear younger than 18 years of age.

Originally, the owner intended to sell sex toys and "yanno, DVDs", but the Davis Business Association and the City of Davis would not allow it.
