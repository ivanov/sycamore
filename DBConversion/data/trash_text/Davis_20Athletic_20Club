The Davis Athletic Club (DAC) may cost more than other gyms (approximately $40 per membership), but it is not a ["meat market"] like ["24 Hour Fitness"] or the ["ARC"].  Most of its members are local Davis families, high school atheletes and UCD Professors, all of whom are very friendly and helpful.  The DAC is seldom crowded; only once have I seen someone have to wait to use a treadmill machine.  Among the amenities offered are 2 heated pools, a co-ed hot tub, a cardio room, a treadmill room, a free weight room, a nautilus room, a sauna, raquetball courts, an indoor soccer field, and many fitness classes.
