I'm currently the President of the ["Davis College Green Party"]. I was the top candidate for ["SOSSS"] in the Fall 2004 ["ASUCD"] elections and I am currently running for ["Senate"] again in the Winter 2005 election as an Official Independent Candidate. 

One of my main goals is getting the ["Countback Amendment"] on the ballot and approved by the voters. This Amendment would change from having the ASUCD President appointing interim Senators to using the Choice Voting data to allow the voters decide who fills vacated Senate seats.

== My Platform (so far): ==

=== Open Government and Less Bureaucracy ===
'''Election Data on the ASUCD Elections Website'''
 *The election data from ASUCD elections should be posted the day the results are announced and remain on the website indefinitely
'''Merge the Health and Well-Being Committee into the Gender and Sexuality Commission'''
 *GASC does what this committee is supposed to do so it’s redundant
'''Audit Creative Media'''
 *The ASUCD website is always outdated and virtually useless. Creative Media is either mismanaged or needs assistance and a solution needs to be created.

=== Save Time and Money ===
'''Cut Spending/Fiscal Responsibility'''
 *The ASUCD government goes on a retreat to Lake Tahoe which costs $2,000. The Senate approved buying a nonfunctional fire truck to shoot tube socks for $5,000 and a laser printer for Campus Copies/Classical Notes for $42,000. These are wastes of money.
'''No Useless Resolutions'''
 *Resolutions that hold no relevance to UC Davis or simply state the opinion of a majority of the Senate are a waste of time. I will never support any of these resolutions.
'''2/3 Amendment for Fee Increases'''
 *I fully support the Constitutional Amendment that requires 2/3 of voters to approve ASUCD fee increases and will do what it takes to get it implemented.

=== Power to the People ===
'''Countback Amendment'''
 *The ASUCD President currently replaces vacated Senate seats but with the Choice Voting data a Countback Election can decide who the voters want in that seat without a special election. I have authored a Constitutional Amendment to carry this out.
'''Expand the Senate'''
 *With Choice Voting an expanded Senate will lead to more representation and thus a greater diversity of opinions. I will work for a larger number of Senators and an odd number of Senators to take tie-breaking voting power away from the Vice-President.
'''Spring Elections for UCSA Delegates?'''
 *Currently the Office of External Affairs appoints the 20 delegates for UC Davis to represent us at the UC Student Association. I will look into having Spring Elections to allow the voters decide who they want representing them. 
'''Advocate for Choice Voting'''
 *I fully support Choice Voting and have advocated for its implementation in the City of Davis to increase student influence in City politics. I will also work on educating the campus about Choice Voting and work on getting a Choice Voting expert on the ASUCD Elections Committee.

In the last election, Jon did an amazing thing. He actually got Republicans to vote for a Green Party person. Unfortunately, there was a conservative candidate who was ranked higher than Jon and won because of a 42 vote difference.

Jon also supports ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"], but mainly himself: ["Senate Candidates"].

Hey Jonathon, I was wondering if you were going to propose a countback bill to the ["Senate"] soon?  I think it's a terrific idea. --["PhilipNeustrom"]

''2005-01-21 20:24:41'' [[nbsp]] I would like to but there are people within ASUCD who don't think it can be introduced because of a line in the Constitution that I believe they are interpreting wrong. I haven't decided what to do for the time being. I'll keep people posted though. --["JonathonLeathers"]

''2005-02-01 00:52:49'' [[nbsp]] Jon, I cannot express how much I agree with the "The ASUCD website is always outdated and virtually useless. Creative Media is either mismanaged or needs assistance and a solution needs to be created."!  But I think part of the problem is a lack of commitment to open information on the side of ASUCD as well. --["PhilipNeustrom"]
