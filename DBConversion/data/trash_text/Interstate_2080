The main freeway going through town, dividing ["South Davis"] from the rest of Davis.  ["Sacramento"] is about 10 miles to the east, while the ["Bay Area"] lies approximately 70 miles to the west.  The freeway spans the entire US, terminating in the West at its junction with U.S. Highway 101 in San Francisco and terminating in the East at its the junction with Interstate 95 in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey.

Exits include ["UC Davis"] (''["Old Davis Rd"]''), ["Richards Blvd"], and ["Mace Blvd"]. Intersects with ["Highway 113"] in Davis.

Oddly enough the freeway expands to 6 lanes before the ["Mondavi Center"] but then bottlenecks to 3 once arriving at the Richards Blvd exit.

Friday nights headed eastward are bad for traffic. Usual locations for accidents are just east of ["Mace Blvd."] and west of ["Richards Blvd."]. If the causeway is blocked, an alternate (eastbound) path is County Road 102 (aka ["Pole Line Rd."]) or ["Highway 113"] north to ["Interstate 5"] south.  If you're in Sacramento and want to avoid the causeway, take ["Interstate 5"] north toward Woodland and exit at County Road 102.  Turn left at the stoplight and proceed straight.  The road will eventually turn into ["Pole Line Rd."] just south of the northern edge of the Davis city limits. See ["Maps" Area Maps] for alternatives to Interstate 80.

See ["Transportation" transportation] for alternative ways to get to Sacramento or the Bay Area.
