Village Bakery makes excellent bread, pastries and pizza. Located in a quaint hole in the wall right across from the ["Amtrak Station"] it easily goes unnoticed. They only have two or three indoor tables but there is lots of pleasant seating ["Outdoor Activities" outside]. 

Pizza can be bought by the slice during the day. This may be the best pizza in all of Davis. Slices cost between $1.50 and $2.00 for your choice of whatever is available. They usually have pepperoni and some sort of vegetable combination. This is excellent ["Cheap Food"]. Sometimes late in the day (ie. dinner time) they will be sold out of pizza in the rotating glass case. Sadly, when this happens you might or might not be able to get some quickly. They often have to devote their small pizza ovens to making take-out orders. Come back another time because the pizza is awesome!

Village Bakery's bread is rivaled only by the bread from ["Nugget" The Nugget], both of which are astonishingly good for such a small town. The Bakery's bread can be bought onsite or at the ["Davis Food Co-Op"] a couple of blocks away.

The Bakery also has an espresso machine, making it a popular spot for train riders to get some caffeine and a cinnamon roll before or after their trip.

Village Bakery supplies bread to a number of local restaurants, including ["Delta of Venus"].
