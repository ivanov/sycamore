Sleeping on campus is a delicate art.  While anyone can sleep at home, it's not always the most convenient option.
Note that it is illegal to sleep on campus.  Make sure you don't get caught.  Three ["Popo"] cars will surround you and tell you not to get caught again.

== During the day ==
  * If it's not too hot out, or too muddy, then sleeping in the Quad is a good choice.  A ton of people sleep in the Quad.

  * ["Griffin Lounge"] is also a favorite spot.  It's always nice and cool, and perfectly quiet.  There's also lots of comfortable chairs.

 * ["Shields Library"] has a few good spots.  In non-fiction, to the right side, there's usually nice cushins to sleep on.  Also, the "window seats" toward the center of each floor provide a lot of lie-down room and make for a cozy spot, provided the sun isn't shining in your direction.
 * ["Women's Center"] has cushy chairs, and nice people who won't stick things in your nose while you sleep there.  The only problem with this is that it is filled with women, and few men.
 * ["Unitrans"] is nice, especially a certain older bus that doesn't really have "seats" per say, more like a soft cushiony bench that just screams, "LIE ON ME!!!"  If you have time to kill, and like sleeping in the car, and like being warm on the bus, you can sleep here.
== During the night ==
During the night you'll need to have snuck into a building that doesn't care you're inside (most have janitors that will kick you out).

  * ["24 Hour Reading Room"].  As long as you look like you were studying before you passed out (i.e. you don't have a blanket and pillow) they won't kick you out.

  * Grass someplace is a safe bet as no one is likely to bother you, but you'll have watch out for sprinklers and animal crap... Really, sleeping in the grass at night is a bad idea.

  * The ["Physics And Geology"] building has a really nice roof.  But that's not all!  They also have a couch up there (at least as of 08-06-04) on the roof that you can sleep in and stare at the stars!  Talk about '''nice'''!  Also, this is likely a good place to take someone if you want to make out with them, maybe.
     * I wasn't able to find this. Is this the floor marked "R" above the 5th floor with all manner of telescopes and stuff? That door was locked. Or was it the terrace thing outside the double-doors on the fourth floor? That was locked too. Or something else? -- ["RaghavKrishnapriyan"]
