||<^(>The Yolo County SPCA Thrift store is one of the handful of ["Thrift Stores"] in Davis. They accept donations and offer a variety of clothing... mostly strange women's clothing however... so if you're looking for T-Shirts or any cool retro clothes, ["All Things Right And Relevant"] is probably a safer bet. [[BR]][[BR]] They usually have a good selection of bicycles and appliances, though (i.e. cameras, stereo systems, etc,) and their book selection is pretty good, by the standards that apply.  (Fewer books than the ["Salvation Army"], but more that you might conceivably want to read.)||<^|3>attachment:spca.jpg||

All thrift stores have their moments.  As far as of strange women's clothes go, ["MikeIvanov"] pieced together the best Holloween costume ever, all thanks to the SPCA Thrift store.
