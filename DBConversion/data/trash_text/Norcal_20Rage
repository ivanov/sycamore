=  Introduction = 

Norcal Rage is what Southern Californians are subjected to for visiting, going to school in, or otherwise living in Northern California.  One instance of Norcal Rage the mean-spirited, feverishly-pitched sermons against the practice of using the article "the" in conjunction with freeway names.  

= Behavior explanation =

The explanations for such behavior vary, but one common observation among those who have studied the phenonemon is that Northern Californians believe that Southern Californians are going somehow to pollute, divert, steal or subvert their precious Norcal resources.  The one resource that Southern California ''actually'' wants from Northern California is water.  But some Northern Californians mistakenly believe that their "way of life," "culturedness," and "excellent weather" are sought after.

= LA Case Study =

This is not, of course, the case.  LA residents are born, live, and die without Northern California's existence ever crossing their minds.  If asked about the "rivalry," their normal reaction is confusion.  Northern Californians visiting LA are usually treated with polite bemusement, as emissaries from a distant land that many believed mythical.

= NoCal / SoCal =

Noted (non-Californian) author William Gibson proposed the terms "NoCal" and "SoCal," but the former has obstinately refused to catch on.

See for reference: ["Two States"].

 * ''I would say SoCal people have an equal distaste for Northern Californians. Look at their contempt for the world ["hella"] as well as their pride in being a larger metro.'' -["JamesDawe"]
 * ''I don't think they have contempt for '''hella'''.  I think they're just confused by it.  It really is a strange word that creeps into just about every grammatical position.  And I don't think SoCal is a metro area, and it's not like any superiority comes from that.  I'll tell you what Southern Californians have pride in: they have great ethnic food and there's a lot of 24-hour restaurants.  Invariably they really think San Francisco is cool.  In short, I don't think there's any anti NorCal sentiment whatsoever.'' -["JaimeRaba"]
