Although only open until 5pm, Posh Bagel is a mini bakery that makes their own bagels, bread loafs and pastries every morning.  They sell all their baked goods either plain or as hot or cold sandwiches.  Some of the sandwiches use cream cheese creatively, for instance the BLTCC.  A variety of fruit salads (sliced melons and berries) are also available.

They also serve Java City coffee, which you might like better than the ["Starbucks"] coffee next door.  They also have various milk teas and Thai tea with optional tapioca pearls.

Although not free, you can get a clear ["WiFi Hot Spots" WiFi signal] from the ["Starbucks"] next door.

It appears to be family owned, and they are very friendly to customers.

There are a small but growing number of people who call the place "Pork Bagel" because the "Posh" in painted sign in the window looks like it says "Pork".
