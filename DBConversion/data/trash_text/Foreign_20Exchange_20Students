''2005-01-27 21:27:47'' [[nbsp]] Should we list some places exchange students come from ? --["BryanBell"]

''2005-01-27 21:30:46'' [[nbsp]] I'm thinking we could also list the major? --["BryanBell"]------
''2005-01-27 21:32:21'' [[nbsp]] can't foreign students come from a wide, wide range of universities? --["JackHaskel"]------
''2005-01-28 11:27:48'' [[nbsp]] I don't know. I just thought it would be interesting to see what unviversties they do come from. I doubt that people will be adding too many schools to easily fit on the list. --["BryanBell"]------

''2005-01-28 13:39:55'' [[nbsp]] Reciprocity Students, also called Foreign Exchange Students, can come from any University that the [http://eac.ucdavis.edu UC Education Abroad Program] exchanges with, or, really, any University at all.  If ["UC Davis"] and the prospective Reciprocity Student's University don't have an exchange program, the student can contact a Non-UC program for help.  They can also apply and enroll directly into the UC Davis as a transfer student, which requires a student visa. --["SummerSong"]------
