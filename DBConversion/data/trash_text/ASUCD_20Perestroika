=ASUCD Perestroika: Fall 2004 - ? =
We are currently undergoing a peroid of unprecedented interest in ["ASUCD"] reforms.  Persons without official positions within ASUCD are enthusiastically participating in the writing of bills to change perceived injustice in ASUCD to a degree markedly higher than any time in known ASUCD history.  Some have declared this renaissance "the ASUCD [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika Perestoika]."

This writer would like to add some [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasnost glasnost] to the perestoika in hopes of garnering yet more public involvement.  The idea is to make some of the current reform proposals available here for public perusal and contribution to the writing process.

A bill to add this “ASUCD Judicial Reform Act,” a constitutional amendment, to the Winter 2005 election ballot. 

'''Background:''' 	In 2001, the elections process within ASUCD was taken entirely from the jurisdiction of the ["ASUCD Court"].  The ["Elections Committee"] was given direct jurisdiction over alleged campaign violations.  Appeal of the Committee’s decisions on these cases could be made to the Campus Judicial Board (["Campus Judicial Board"]) of Student Judicial Affairs (["Student Judicial Affairs"]), a non-ASUCD body.

In effect this has shielded the Elections Committee from judicial review within ASUCD.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_jurisdiction Original jurisdiction] over elections complaints fell upon a body that had not been assembled with an interest in judicial matters.  The primary purpose of the Elections Committee is the administration of elections, and no members are hired for expertise or interest in jurisprudence.  Furthermore the appeal process from the Elections Committee leads not to the Court but to SJA, a place far removed from ASUCD experience that most students are fortunate enough to know little about.  And if the CJB of SJA were to actually issue a binding opinion involving orders upon the Elections Committee, we would have the ideologically repugnant situation of ASUCD operations being ordered by a non-ASUCD entity.  CJB has avoided this however, refusing to issue binding orders pursuant to its [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_jurisdiction appellate jurisdiction] over the Elections Committee, which creates the similarly alarming circumstance of no entity actually exercising authority over the Committee.

This maldesigned system has since 2001 led to increasing cynicism and distrust of the electoral process in ASUCD.  By the 2004 Fall election this erupted into a ["Election Statement Controversy" major controversy], with at least five cases coming before SJA, numerous Aggie articles, and significant damage to ASUCD’s reputation.

This bill seeks to rectify this situation by placing the ASUCD Court in the appellate role rather than SJA.  The Elections Committee shall retain “original jurisdiction” over elections complaints, and its decisions may be appealed to the ASUCD Court regarding “matters of law.”  This means that it shall remain the Elections Committee’s role to investigate allegations, and the Court shall not interfere with it’s decisions as to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_of_fact preponderance of evidence].  The Committee’s interpretation of or adherence to the bylaws, however, may be challenged in an appeal before the ASUCD Court.  In this manner the administration of elections and the interpretation of jurisprudence are placed with the entities most qualified in their respective areas, there is a check-and-balance upon the elections process, and ASUCD operations shall not be ordered by non-ASUCD bodies.
 

Article VII

Section 1	The judicial authority of the ASUCD shall be vested in one ASUCD Court (hereafter referred to as the ASUCD Court) [[s(start)]]and the Student Judicial Affairs / Campus Judicial Board[[s(stop)]].

[Sections 8 through 12 deleted]
__Section 8	The ASUCD Court shall have appellate jurisdiction over elections.  The Elections Committee shall retain original jurisdiction over potential disqualifications or violations in elections, but specific questions of law may be appealed to the ASUCD Court.__

== Impeachment ==
Currently ASUCD elected officials cannot be impeached, whereas in the so-called real world they almost invariably can be.

Status: not being worked on

''2005-01-22 08:07:53'' [[nbsp]] Somehow the phrase "Campus Judicial Board of Student Judicial Affairs" was used... and now it seems to have stuck. The name is incorrect, and implies that CJB is merely an arm of SJA -- which is false. I wrote the Aggie about this (because their articles make the same mistake and I felt it was potentially misleading to their readers) and they apologized, but did not publish my letter. They also continue to make the same mistake. *shrug* --["ElvinLee"]
