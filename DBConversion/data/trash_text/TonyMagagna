Tony is a graduate student instructor in the English department at UCD, and--for better or worse--he has had many of the current DavisWiki users as students at one time or another. He's been around Davis for a while, and he's a big fan of the place, so he enjoys learning new things about the area, and contributing new facts himself.

He's also not so sure about writing about himself in the third person...
