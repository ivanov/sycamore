The Physics and Geology Building is home to ["Physics"] and, well, ["Geology"].  It is located west of Mrak Hall.

This is one of the coolest buildings on campus.  Not only are there all sorts of really complicated pieces of technical equipment all around, but it's geeky to the max.

On the elevators, sometimes one of these is in there with you.  It's a chair designed to show off the affects of the acceleration of the elevator.  The chair is springy.

The residents of this building, by and large, encourage dumpster divers.  Stuff on the loading dock is fair game.

It also has a *secret* passage way, that you need to use an elevator (from a near by *secret* lecture hall) to get to!
