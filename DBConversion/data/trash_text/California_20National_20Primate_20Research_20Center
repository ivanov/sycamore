This highly secure research facility located at the end of Hutchison houses about 4,600 monkeys. The center is very controversial, leading some detractors to refer to it as the "Monkey Farm".  The $24 million facility has made recent discoveries about autism.  

In February 2002 a monkey escaped, but it ended up crawling into a drain pipe and being ground up by an impeller.

Note: An earlier revision contained reference to the facility being "burned down in the 60's".  The facility was founded in 1962, and I can find no record of any burning down or violent protests.
