So... you're on campus, desperately searching for a stapler. Where do you go?

Public staplers:
 * ["MU Information Desk"]
 * Food Science Library in ["Cruess Hall"]
 * ["CSIF Support"] in ["Kemper Hall"]
 * ["Language Learning Center"] in the bottom of ["Olson Hall"]
 * ["Outdoor Adventures"]
 * ["The California Aggie"] in ["Lower Freeborn Hall"] - Just act like you work there and take off.

Part of the ["Rob Roy for Senate"] and ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"] platform is to bring staplers back to the computer labs. Just bolt them to the tables, dammit. Do whatever is needed.
