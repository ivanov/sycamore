UC Berkeley, located in the ["Bay Area"], was the first University of California campus. Berkeley is also the most famous UC and always seems to be discovering some unknown element or snagging a new nobel laureate.

UC Davis and UC Berkeley share some bonds. At one time, Davis was the agricultural arm of Berkeley. (See ["Town History"]) Davis is now a separate university, but intercampus collaborative research and projects still occur between respective departments. There is even a ["Davis Berkeley Shuttle" shuttle service] that ["Transportation And Parking Services" TAPS] provides between the two campuses (["Shields Library" UCD Shields Library] to the Berkeley West Gate).

Another aspect of the Berkeley-Davis relationship is in the student body. A certain fascination exists with Davis students about its more reputable older sister. Berkeley is the topic of a fair number of conversations in Davis (like this Wiki page). Not surprsingly, the California Aggie has a large number of [http://www.google.com/search?as_q=Berkeley&num=10&hl=en&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=www.californiaaggie.com&safe=off articles about Berkeley].

 * ''Which campus is most famous is a difficult thing, however, I'd say that UCLA is likely more well known in the rest of the country.  How much of this is influenced by how near Hollywood and the entertainment industries is questionable, but, while Berkeley has an excellent academic reputation, UCLA is likely significantly more well known.'' -- ["JabberWokky" jw]
   * but, but we're the oldest -["LenaGranik" lg]
     * No we aren't. Berkeley is due to the fact we were Berkeley until we separated. ["StarrOleary"]
       * I believe that when lg says "we", she is referring to Berkeley.  She is a Berkeley alumni. (Keep in mind that this is the Davis Community Wiki, not the UCDavis Wiki). -- ["JabberWokky" jw] 
   * The only reason why UCLA would be more well known is because of football, which they used to be good at. Currently, UCB is ranked #4 in the country, whereas UCLA has pretty much nothing to show. Now, mix in Berkeley's academic reputation, as well as its historicly known hyper-liberals, and there's no way UCLA stands a chance to UCB's reputation. - ["GiladGurantz"]
     * ''All I'm talking about is nationally.  I'm betting that if you asked a random sampling of people in, say, Rochester, NY, Alexandria, VA, Charleston, SC and Miami, FL, far more of them would know what UCLA was than Berkeley.  Hell, I'd bet you that you'd have a good chunk of people who wouldn't know where "Berkeley" is ("Um... near San Alto or something, right?").  I get people all the time who think I can drive down to LA or up to Seattle for an evening to see a band perform.  From the opposite side of the country, there's always a dim view of what exists.  From that perspective, UCLA is more well known.  I'd say sports, Hollywood and the proximity to a nationally well known city (L.A.) are all contributing factors.'' -- ["JabberWokky" jw]
      * I second JabberWokky's statements. Nobody outside of California knows much about "UC Berkeley". They may know of "Cal" but not of its academic reputation.  Everybody knows UCLA, at least for its sports program and having baby blue in its school colors. I'm also pretty sure that those who have never applied to a UC have no idea that UCLA and Cal are sister schools. - ["RaynatoCastro"]
