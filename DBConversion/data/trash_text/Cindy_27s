Cindy's is a diner style restaurant, similar to Dennys.  The best meal there is breakfast, but lunch and dinner are also fine, and prices are reasonable.  
It doesn't stand out much and is relatively far from campus, but it is cheaper than ["Baker's Square"] which is much closer to the student population of davis.

Cindy's is one of the best cheap, little breakfast places in town!  Try their biscuits and gravy, although their pancake or waffle specials are also very decent.

It's not a good place to go if you're nursing a hangover in the morning.  The coffee's fine, but they expect you to eat and leave, and get sort of confused when you hang around holding your head, wincing, and drinking coffee

My food experience at Cindy's is less than stellar.  I found their food to be extremely bland, with an odd texture.  Service was OK. --["PaulLanzi"]

I had a pretty good ["Breakfast" breakfast] here.  Diner food, but the place is cozy. --["PhilipNeustrom"]
