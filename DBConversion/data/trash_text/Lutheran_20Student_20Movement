Lutheran Student Movement (LSM) is a branch of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America ([http://www.elca.org/ ELCA]); the local branch in Davis meets at ["The Belfry"].  There used to be two ["Student Organizations" student organizations] associated with the Belfry, one called the Canterbury Club which represented the Episcopal Church.  However, ["SPAC"] got annoyed that the same people were involved in two clubs, so the Canterbury Club was discontinued.

LSM is a liberal Christian group, in general.  There have been lesbian staff members, as well as ["Students for an Orwellian Society" Orwellian] officers -- they believe that you do not have to have the same opinions to worship the same God.  They are not aggressive in pushing their beliefs on members, since the Bible can be interpreted so many ways that no one knows who is right.  Besides, being pushy is just rude.

=== Events ===
Every week there is a Soup Supper and a discussion on Thursday night at 6PM, at ["The Belfry"].  It's cooked by volunteers, so it's free food.  Let me repeat, free food.

They also organize a free lecture series called the [http://www.thebelfry.org/staugustine.html St. Augustine Chair] once a year.
