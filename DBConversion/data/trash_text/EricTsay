  Eric is a second year computer science and engineering major. Originally from San Jose, he enjoys to hike and explore the south bay and swim on warm sunny days. He lived in the ["Tercero G Building"], his first year (2003-2004) at Davis. He likes to hang out with his G Funk buddies and celebrate every occasion with them as much as possible. Currently Eric lives in ["South Davis"] with three great housemates and Sarah the mouse. Occasionally during the quarter, Eric takes ["Amtrak"] home to San Jose.
