One of two independents in the ["ASUCD"] ["Senate"], Donnie in some sense represents the little guy/common man.  He does good stuff for the students; be nice to him. '''His birthday is Sunday January 23rd. If you see him then wish him happy birthday.'''

The ["LEAD"] candidates on Senate like to think of him as a member of their slate.  This is primarily because he has a few leftist tendencies which tend to agree with Leadite values.  However, he is still very independent, and is likely to push an issue further than anyone on LEAD would -- he has no slate to support, making politically risky manouvers more beneficial and less costly than for slate members.

As evidence of his sanity, he is often heard muttering something about how much he hates working in ["ASUCD"].  Keep this in mind before you consider running for office.
