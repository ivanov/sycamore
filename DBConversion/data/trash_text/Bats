Although often mistaken for ["Crow Migration" crows] at night, the skies of Davis sometimes fill up with hordes of bats.  Woodland is especially populated with large bat colonies.  Bats also live under the ["Yolo Causeway"], and can be seen flying out at dusk in great clouds.

There's a colony living beneath the pedestrian walkway over Covell, near ["Davis Senior High School"].  Sometimes they're also found near ["University Mall"].

These handy and très gothique insect hunters help keep Davis bug free.  Next time you see wings flapping above you, look close.
