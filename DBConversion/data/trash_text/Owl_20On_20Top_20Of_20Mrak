On top of Mrak Hall, there's an owl!  It's made of wood, I suspect.

There are actually several buildings on campus, mostly around ["Mrak Hall"], outfited with the fake owls.  See if you can spot them all (owl?) for fun and profit.


''Once upon a time, a friend and I spent at least ten minutes trying to scare the owl into flying away.  In our defense, it was dark.'' -- ["ChrisTakemura"]

''I'm pretty sure they use those things (owl decoys) to keep pigeons away.'' ["TonyMagagna"]

''If I recall correctly, what I was told when I was on a campus tour before attending this fine institution was that the owl on Mrak is specifically in front of the chancellor's office.  Being able to identify his office makes him 3 points less faceless, and aids in shaking one's fist at him'' - ["KrisFricke"]
