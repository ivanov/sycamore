Two of these buses were purchased back in 1968 by ["ASUCD"] direct from England to attract people to use the service. This was the inception of ["Unitrans"], the only transit company in the United States to use authentic London double deck buses in daily service. At some point, the busses were converted to run on Compresed Natural Gas. ([http://unitrans.ucdavis.edu/schedule/faq.cfm source])
