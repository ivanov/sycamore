["Southern California"] is mostly desert. The weather is mild, however there is very little annual precipitation. The vast majority of water consumed in Southern California is pumped in from elsewhere. According to the NRDC this activity accounts for up to 7% of the total energy consumed by the state every year. That is an astounding statistic. The environmental impact of owning a grass lawn in Southern California is probably comparable to that of owning an SUV. What's even more shocking is that during the severe droughts that California is prone to, Southern Californians paid the same rates or even less that their Northern counterparts.

This plundering must stop! LA is sore on the face of this planet! Let's split the state and watch all that dirty money flow north faster than the water we pump south!

''2004-12-11 21:33:55'' [[nbsp]] Wow. Such raw hate... because of water use. Wow. I feel compelled to note that not all of southern CA is in LA. In fact, there are large parts of southern CA that are indeed isolated from LA, places that even rely on their own water resources. Shockingly enough, some people in these towns even have green lawns. Of course, those lawns may get a little brown durring a prolonged drought, but clearly, they are all irresponsible bastards. - ["EricKlein"]------
''2004-12-12 03:30:15'' [[nbsp]] Wow.  Look at the nearly lunatic-caliber rage.  You know, most of SoCal's water comes from out of state.  I have this strong suspicion that the fewer heating costs actually produce SOME environmental impact savings to offset.  I'm not exactly sure why so many people hate LA.  It is urban sprawl, but that's not just a SoCal thing.  I think it may have some "classist" undertone to it.  But anyway, there's not a lot of space for big lawns in your typical LA bungalo. - ["JaimeRaba"]------
''2004-12-12 12:06:53'' [[nbsp]] I think you guys need to turn up the sensitvity on your sarcasm detectors. I don't seriously hate SoCal. In fact I really like SanDiego a lot, and it is true that most water going to areas south of LA comes from out of state. I just thought this would liven up the whole SoNorCal debate currently raging on the wiki. - ["DanMasiel"]

''2004-12-12 20:11:29'' [[nbsp]] Tulare Lake was a giant lake that was sucked dry from LA. It was 200 square miles, millions of years old and now it is gone. The Owens valley was raped by LA for water.  I agree. Split the state and let LA suffer. They do get a lot of water from the Colorado river but if you drive down I-5 you have seen the aqueduct, all you so-cal folks know you take the water from Norcal. Hell, the Sacramento Delta supplies a good portion of the LA water system so all of L.A. should stop routing for the Lakers and start screaming GO KINGS because it is Sacramento that makes sure you don't die of thirst. - ["RobRoy"]

''2004-13-12 02:40:29'' [[nbsp]] Honestly, I think everyone knows that the water distribution to Southern California is problematic.  But I think the financial might of that side of the state would find other water if push came to shove.  ''I think the most important part of this discussion is the fact that Southern Californians have no ill-will towards Northern California whatsoever, but they are constantly the objects of fanatcial rants against "their" behavior, where generally these arrangements are made in Sacramento, where there's plenty of non-LA votes in the state government.''  So obviously, the majority of the state is complciit in this somewhat ecologically unwise water distribution.  And you also should realize that the VAST majority of southern Californians feel badly about the water situation, and do much to save water.  Some cities no longer permit the watering of lawns, washing of cars using non-recycled water--yes you can't wash your car in your driveway, and impose huge fines for going over allotted amounts.  In Northern California, most areas don't even have water meters.  So... there you go. - ["JaimeRaba" jr]

''2004-12-13 02:45:44'' [[nbsp]] I believe only Sacramento has no water meters... which you're right honestly doesn't encourage conservation. Right now the big south vs north debate is over the Bay Bridge and its 4 billion dollars in cost overruns. Instead of the traditional Democrat/Republican split this time its South vs North. - ["JamesDawe"]

''2004-12-13 11:53:24'' [[nbsp]] In Sacramento (and arguably everywhere) votes mean nothing in the face of cold hard hollywood/defence contractor cash. Undeniably SoCal has a lot of clout, for example it seems someone is LA secretly owns Caltrans. The south can complain as much as it wants about the bay bridge, but when it come to getting roads built they are spoiled brats. Most of the freeways damaged in the Northridge Quake (1994) were rebuilt before the Cyprus freeway which was destroyed in 1989. But to south’s credit (or discredit) their transportation infrastructure is far more dependant on cars than ours is.  - ["DanMasiel"]
