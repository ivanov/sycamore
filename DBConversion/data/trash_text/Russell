Russell Blvd. stretches along most of Davis. When Russell Blvd. passes A St. heading East, and transitions from campus to ["Downtown"], it becomes ["5th St."] Russell skates along most of the north side of ["Campus"], and is also home to ["Frat Row"].

If you keep driving/walking/biking West down Russell, you will end up in ["Winters"]. After Winters, it becomes County Road 128, then crosses into Napa County and becomes Capay Valley Road, passing along ["Lake Berryessa"]. At some point, you can do something or other and end up in ["Napa"] at which point you have gone way the hell past the bounds of this wiki and you're on your own, baby.
