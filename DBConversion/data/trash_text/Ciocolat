Ciocolat is perhaps the least "academic" of the coffee shops in Davis -- in so far as academic implies a sort of pulling out of books and papers to ruffle through.  Gone are the countless students with ["OChem"] books and powerpoint slides -- instead we find a quaint little house on the corner, a patio filled with people enjoying each other, and innumerable delicate dessert items.

In addition to desserts, Ciocolat also has a wide selection of coffee and beverages.  One of the chocolate cakes is essentially a giant truffle -- it's completely breathtaking.



  * The Chocolate Raspberry Mousse Cake is something everyone should try. It's a single serving cake that is perfect for two to share, especially for dessert after a romantic dinner date. ["Ciocolat"] also offers some of the most beautifully designed custom cakes and desserts that I've ever seen. Go to them if you ever need a special fancy cake for a special fancy occasion. Be prepared to spend quite a bit of cash, but every bite will be well worth it. - ["TerraSmithers"]
  * Another Nice Desert is the Chocolate Decadence Cake.  It has chocolate everywhere and is a really moist cake with mousse and more. - ["RohiniJasavala"]
  * And let's not forget that it's not just about cake and dessert -- you can go there for lunch or dinner as well. They have great sandwiches, and offer wine. - ["OliverKreylos"]
