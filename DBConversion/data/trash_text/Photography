= Buying a camera =
There are only really two places to buy a camera in Davis:
 *["Ritz Camera"]
 *[http://www.ebay.com ebay] 

= Developing Film =
Developing film is rather expensive.  Buying film is about $2 a roll and then developing + printing it is about $8.  That's $10 for every roll of film you shoot.  
== Color developing ==
For color film, getting "just the negatives" developed at ["Rite Aid"] or some other similar place will probably save you money.  This costs about $2 for 24 exposures.  Then you can go to ["Hart Hall"] or ["Meyer Hall"] (if you're a student) and use the negative scanner to scan the negatives in.  You can actually ''scan them in at higher quality than you could from a print!''  If you use a computer a lot then this will allow you to post the photos online, send around, etc.  If you ever wanted to print them out you'd likely have to spend some money.

== B&W developing ==
["Photoquick"] is the only place in Davis that does B&W inhouse, all other film developers send it out. That being said, photoquick is still pretty expensive. You'd be better off shooting CN, or developing it yourself.
["Segundo"] used to have a wetlab, but this has since dissapeared
The ["Craft Center"] has a photolab, but you must pay for a membership or a day pass.
(put places where you can do your own here), craft center, photo labs on campus, bookstore chemicals)

= Great places to take pictures =
Everywhere![[BR]]

-----
''"Kissing the war goodbye" is a great picture and all, but if this page is about photography in Davis I think we ought to have a photo related to Davis.  I propose a photo contest wherein candidate photos are nominated (via comments below?) and duly voted upon (also via comments?  or I could do an lj poll.  Could we poll on here?).  Maybe we could even have a different picture every month or something, what ho!  Pictures should preferably be, I propose, in or about Davis, depicting the life and times of Davis, and maybe even by a wiki-er! ''-["KrisFricke"]
