One of the lower-priced pizza places. Coupons come in the mail all the time and you can get a free 2-liter of soda if you do carry-out.

While their crust is not the best, their toppings are good and varied.  You can get tomato sauce, but pesto and white garlic sauces are also available.  If you go wild on thick toppings, you can wind up with a soggy pizza through sheer volume of ingredients on top.
