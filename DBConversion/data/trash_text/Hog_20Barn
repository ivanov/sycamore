At some point in 2003 the powers that be in UCD decided to relocate the Hog Barn, a historic relic from some distant end of ["Campus"], to the pleasant grassy space between the ["The Silo" south silo] and ["Bainer Hall"]. But like any decent ["University Construction"] project, they gave up on renovated it after some time. The dilapidated barn currently sits within a fenced-off area of unmowed grass, cold and alone.

''Why did the university do this? Put a dilapidated barn on a nice piece of open lawn. It's cluttering up the area between Bainer and the Silo.'' -["JamesDawe"]
