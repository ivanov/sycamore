YSDHC began as a website [http://www.ysdhc.com] created for the purpose of putting food reviews, videos, and fart jokes on the internet. Today it is a forum for Davis locals who share and interest in hardcore/metal/punk etc. Its a great place to meet people and find out about upcoming shows. 

Beyond the webiste YSDHC is a brutally crucial xCREWx who will totally hit you in the head with a lead pipe if you so much as look at us the wrong way.
