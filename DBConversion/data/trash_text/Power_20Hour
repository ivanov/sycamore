The concept of Power Hour is pretty simple. All you need is a lot of beer, a shot glass for each person, and a clock. Simply take a shot of beer every minute for one hour. This is a pretty popular ["Drinking games" drinking game] though it takes some precision to keep track of the time or else things can get sloppy fast. One recommended method is to make a Power Hour mix of 60 songs that play for one minute each, that way you can just take a shot every time the music switches.

For those that have already mastered Power Hour, the next step would be to join the ["Century Club"]....
