One of the many majors at ["Campus" UC Davis] is philosophy. Many rude things have been said by and about philosophers.

UC Davis's Philosophy department is composed mostly of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy Analytic philosophers] though there are such classes as 19th Century and 20th Century Philosophy, and Winter 2005 has a Religious Existentialism class (198A).


== UCD Philosophy Courses ==
=== Rev. Chad's recommended courses ===

Most classes by Prof. Mattey, who teaches most of the non-analytic and some of the symbolic logic classes, which is an interesting combination. He puts class notes online with hyperlinks and such. Very amusing lecturer, and he uses examples from the news and his family life. In Theory of Knowledge, he started each day with "Philosophy in the news" from that or the previous day.

Prof. Cummins is also an interesting lecturer. Expect not to understand everything from readings since he assigns articles from people deeply imbedded in whatever research and doesn't expect the students to understand everything. Plan to read through and get the basic idea.

11. Philosophy East and West is generally only taught during the Summer, but has a really funny prof, as long as you are into dark humor. The only other place to get eastern philosophy is "Chinese Philosophy" in the Religious Studies Dept.

If you are good at logic and math, take 12. Intro to Symbolic Logic. If you are a Philosophy major who is not good at math and logic, good luck.

15. Bioethics is a great course with interesting current topics. Prof. Dworkin is a great lecturer.

102. Theory of Knowledge amused ["RevChad"] and reinforced his general skepticism.

151. Nineteenth Century European Philosophy is about crazy people and their theories, such as "Idealism in Schopenhauer and Hegel, dialectical materialism in Marx, irrationalism in Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and Dostoevsky." Take it when you can since it is rarely offered.

156. Contemporary Analytic Philosophy is fun and Cummins offers an interesting critique of the Analytic Philosophy you will see so much of.

157. Twentieth Century European Philosophy ["RevChad"] is signed up for this Winter '05, since Mattey is cool and the philosophers seem crazy enough to be interesting. 

=== aec's recommendations ===

108. Philosophy of Biology. This (I've heard said) is supposedly one of the hardest philo classes. I took it my first quarter at UCD, and it's still my favorite class.

119. Philosophy of Law. Take this class. Rosati is a great lecturer and the course gives valuable insights to current incoherent views of justice.

157. Twentieth Century European Philosophy I'm looking forward to this class. Of course I don't play well with analytic philosophy.

''this will actually be useful and updated soon.''
