From [http://www.acmetheatre.net/ Acme's Web Site]:

''Acme Theatre Company is an independent, self-sustaining community theatre group for young artists of high school age. Its mission is to present plays of high literary quality while providing opportunities for young people to learn various acting and technical skills. Acme Theatre Company is an organization run entirely by the young people themselves under the direction of a small cadre of adult mentors.''

Acme performs in the ["Veterans Memorial Theatre"].  In the summer, a free outdoor performance is given as a gift to the town of Davis for its many years of support.  For many years, these performances were held on the ["Pence Gallery"] stage, which disappeared with the gallery renovation.  Now performances are held on the outdoor stage behind the ["Davis Art Center"]
