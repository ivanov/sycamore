This is a good one for those lazy Tuesday evenings.. You know, the kind where you don't have anything to do, and "Gone in 60 seconds" is playing on TV for the 40-billionth time. Con Air, Face/Off or The Rock will also work.

'''First''', pour yourself as many shots as you have glasses for. This could get very ugly ''very quickly'' if you use hard liquor, so I'd suggest starting with beer or some sort of mixed shot.

'''Second''', start watching the movie.

'''Now''', ''here's the important part'': Watch Nicholas Cage closely. Every time he looks perplexed, '''TAKE A SHOT'''.

Just in case you're a visual learner, here's a diagram to help you:

Whoever makes it the longest wins! (it's pretty tough to make it through the whole film)

Or, you can play alone. When you pass out, ''you win''! But it's less pathetic with at least one friend.

(btw, read the warning at the top of ["Drinking games"]. Nicholas Cage doesn't like it when you get alcohol poisoning..)
