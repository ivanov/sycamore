Once upon a time there was a band in Davis named Lawsuit.  It was a 10 piece band, known for its quirky lyrics and its 4-piece horn section (the Horns of Adequacy).  The band played up and down California, were popular entertainment for the ["Whole Earth Festival"] and regulars at the ["Palms Playhouse"] when it was still here in Davis.

The band broke up in 1996 and its lead singer, [http://wheel.dcn.davis.ca.us/~basykes/paul.htm Paul Sykes] died in 2000.

People still ask ["Armadillo Records"] for CDs and are now directed to [http://www.timbertrout.net/lawsuit/index1.html The Lawsuit Graveyard] for history, photos, and a download site for every song Lawsuit ever recorded.
