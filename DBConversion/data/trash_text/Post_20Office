The main post office is located at the corner of 5th and Pole Line, across the intersection from the ["DMV"]. This is where you go to ship, put mail on hold, pick up mail, submit passport applications, etc. PO Boxes are also available. After hours you can still buy stamps and ship packages with the Automated Postal Center machine in the lobby.

While you are waiting in line, you can admire the mural of old Davis landmarks above the counters.  Or you can step outside to view ["Toad Tunnel" Toad Hollow], the decorated end of one of the nationally famous ["Toad Tunnel" Davis frog tunnels].
