Covell Blvd is one of the main streets in Davis, connecting ["West Davis"], ["North Davis"], and over the ["Train Station" train] tracks to ["East Davis"] as it runs West to East.  The whole boulevard is completely straight with no turns whatsoever.  It is the last Davis exit as you travel North on ["Highway 113"].

Heading west, Covell turns into Highway 128, which you can take to ["Winters"] and then all the way to the coast, where it joins up with Highway 1 south of Mendocino. It's an absolutely gorgeous drive, but it takes ''forever'' because of all the twists and turns.
