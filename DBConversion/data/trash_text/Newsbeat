Like any good newstand should, Newsbeat offers a large selection of newspapers, magazines, greeting cards, candy, snacks and tobacco products.  If you're looking for newspapers or magazines, especially more counter-culture leaning ones, Newsbeat has the best selection in Davis.  They usually have the most recent copy of 2600.  They also carry a lot of Jones Soda flavors along with Jones Juice products (so yummy!)

They have a pretty good selection of tobacco products, including certain products that aren't available in other stores. They also have a small selection of international candies like ["Cost Plus World Market"] does.

There is also a ["Public Internet Terminals" public-access computer] here which works most of the time.  It is maintained by ["LUGOD"], much as is the computer at ["Chamonix"] in North Davis.  It features internet access, of course.
