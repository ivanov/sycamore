Once upon a time, the United States was graced with the presidency of Abraham Lincoln.  Among the greatest triumphs of his career were the Emancipation Proclamation and leading the Union through the horror of the Civil War, both monumental achievements that will forever hold a prominent place in American history.  It is only appropriate, then, that almost sixty years after his death (that's the 1920s for those of you playing along at home), a huge fucking highway gets built in his name.  A cross-continental highway, to be exact, tearing across the purple mountains' majesty and fruited plains, from New York straight to San Francisco.  Davis happened on its way, and part of Highway 40 went through Davis via Olive Drive, First, B Street, and ["Russell"].  Long after the highway is gone, a marker with Abe's face remains in ["Central Park"] at the corner of B and ["Russell"].

The plaque on it reads:

''Lincoln Highway Marker
[[BR]]One of the markers erected by the California automobile association in the 1920s to designate the California portion of the Lincoln Highway from New York City to San Francisco.  The Highway followed US 40 from ["Sacramento"] through Davis via Olive Dr.  First and B St. and Russell Blvd.

Another marker is located at Russell and Arthur in ["West Davis"].

There used to be gas stations in this part of Davis because of the Lincoln Highway. The Olive Drive area and the intersection with Richards had gas stations, restaurants (the Sno-White drive-in, which became Ju-Ju's, which then became ["Redrum Burger"]), and lodging (an auto court, now Slatter's Court). There were three gas stations within town along the route. Two of them were on opposing sides of B Street at the intersection of B and First, while the third was on the southwest corner of Fifth and B, as the highway turned west out into the countryside past the entrance to ["Campus"] and towards ["Winters"].
