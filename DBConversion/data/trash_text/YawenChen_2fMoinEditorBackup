So, this is my little home on the Wiki.
[[Thumb(mememe.png,left)]]

I'm a ["Mathematics"] major here at Davis.

I have a ["LiveJournal"] which at [http://livejournal.com/~codetoad].  I don't seem to update it as much as I should, though.

My email address is philipn at the gmail daught comm.  My AOL Instant Messenger name is {{{CodeToad01}}}, and I'm on that fairly often if you want to chat.

= Some Favorite Pages =
 * ["Night Time"] - Find out what's open late at night!  Literally the most important resource in Davis :P
 * ["Davis Map"]
 * ["Cleanest Bathrooms"]
 * ["Payphone Project"]

= What do I do on the Wiki? =
I make a lot of edits.  What do I usually edit?  These are my most common edits:
 * I link phrases and terms to pages in order to add more stucture.
 * I remove comments and try to integrate them into the page's body if possible.
 * I take differing viewpoints or arguments and attempt to find a common ground.  Nearly any argument or difference of opinion can be solved by merely expanding the writeup to be larger, more general, and less specific.  ["Students for an Orwellian Society"] is a great example (check out the revision history).

I also have a ["PhilipNeustrom:To Do" To Do] page that you likely do not care about.

''Davis from the Inside Out by William D. Diemer. National housing register, 216 F Street, PMB 17.  This is an interesting compilation of a ton of Davis related information that can be purchased for $15 at ["Newsbeat"].  I might buy it to help out with facts/info.''

''2004-12-07 13:56:46'' [[nbsp]] Phillip always edits out the viciousness of my entries. He is the Jiminy Cricket on my Wiki shoulder. - ["RobRoy"]------
''2004-12-08 21:33:01'' [[nbsp]] Thanks for the editing on the DCOC page...Now I know how to make images borderless.   - ["BevSykes"]------
''2004-12-14 04:48:47'' [[nbsp]] We should do something to lock comments while a page is being edited.  It's annoying a lot of people when you get an edit conflict because someone used the comment box. - ["MikeIvanov"]------
''2004-12-15 14:25:29'' [[nbsp]] I'll look into the Abandoned Pages macro after finals. - ["MikeIvanov"]

''2005-01-07 14:34:05'' [[nbsp]] I removed those photos just to be on the safe side.  According to that Google Answers thing, it may be cutting it close, and may get the parents upset.  I'm sure we can find other photos, for example from farther away where children aren't identifiable. --["MikeIvanov"]------
''2005-01-07 14:41:22'' [[nbsp]] As far as photos of adults, I wouldn't worry about that too much.  We can remove them if there's a complaint.  I think the issue with children is much more sensitive, and it wouldn't be the children themselves who will complain but their parents. --["MikeIvanov"]
  * I removed that photo from the Joe Sherman page because he's likely to be pissed off upon reading the page and I took the photo without his permission inside of an In-N-Out..If you think it's cool then feel free to put it back.  --["PhilipNeustrom"]
