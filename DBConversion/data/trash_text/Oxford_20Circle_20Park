Oxford Circle Park is also known as Little Big People's Park. It's awesome. It's got a playground that's like a regular playground except, well, big. There's a giant geometric-like pyramid with ropes to climb on and a weird thing that looks sort of like it's supposed to be a basketball hoop and a hammock and a secret hideout in the air that spins(reminiscent of those torture cages but nevertheless very fun). There's also this slide where people pee and a fireman pole and a bunch of other crap. Of course, there's also a lot of grass.

One of the greatest things to 'play' on at the playground is the merry-go-round--you know the type, the kind they have to remove because too many kids end up flying off of them. Nevertheless, the Big Peoples' merry-go-round is not for the faint of heart, nor for the sober. It is a highly popular location for the inebriated. But either way, the Big People's Park can be enjoyed by those both big and small, so check it out sometime!


Most of the current equipment (one may notice a striking difference between the wooden tower and swings and the new stuff) was put in over the summer of 2002, replacing a weird disintigrating tire-hammock-thing. ["KrisFricke"] would like to mention he was one of three people actively involved in choosing the current equipment, while on the City Renovations sub-Committee for the park in the spring of 2002.

During Spring Quarter, the grass is filled with sunbathing students. ["KenBloom"] wishes the park were not filled with nearly naked sunbathers.  Others don't mind as much.
