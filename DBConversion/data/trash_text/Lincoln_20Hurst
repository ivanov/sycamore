Dr. Lincoln D. Hurst is the ["Religious Studies"] department's claim to fame. He taught most of the religious studies courses related to Christianity and the New Testament. His classes are always packed and full of open or closetted fans. Students find his comical style of teaching endearing and interesting. It keeps the material fun and alive. 

Dr. Hurst is an internationally recognized scholar and historian who has published extensively on a wide variety of topics, including history, the Bible, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and film. 

His formal education includes two degrees from Princeton (1973 and 1976) and the doctorate of philosophy from Oxford University, England (1982). He is a tenured, full-time professor at ["UC Davis"] where he taught over a hundred courses which have consistently had among the highest enrollments in the University of California. 

He lives in Woodland, California, which he often makes fun of. His hobbies include watching baseball (he remains a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan), football, classical music, taking care of abandoned animals, gardening, and travel. 

He is often seen walking rapidly across campus with his eyes watching the ground. His loafers usually have holes in them as do some of his clothes. He also has a proudly grown beard for that extra scholarly effect.
