Driving in Davis is a challenge, and it's quite a bit different than either ["SoCal"] or ["Bay Area"] driving.  Here are some of the hazards associated with driving in the ["People's Republic of Davis"]:

 * Poorly Timed Traffic Signals.  It's hard to explain how badly timed these are.  Though most lights have sensors, they tend to ignore people for long periods of time.  Conversely, some lights stop a major street any time one car pulls up on the side street.
   * ''Local Yellow Light Rule:'' If it's going to be yellow for any portion of the time that you were in the intersection, you should go.  Everyone else does, as it will likely be a long time before you see green again.  Some people do this on the first few seconds of a red light as well.  This also means you shouldn't race ahead as soon as the light turns green, as even bikes follow the Yellow Light Rule.
 * Traffic Slowing Measures.  In its brilliance, the ["Davis City Council"] designs streets so that people will have to drive slowly through neighborhoods.  Thus we see unnecessary 4-way stops, roundabouts like the one on Alvarado Street, speed humps (you have to take them at 15mph or less - if you care about the parts in your car) and curved roads.  Presumably this is at the behest of the residents.
 * Slow speed limits.  ["Russell" Russell Boulevard] has a speed limit of 30 mph in the ["Central Davis" Central] and ["Downtown"] Davis and 35 mph in ["West Davis"].  Consequently, this road is always congested.
 * Too few lanes.  This is especially apparent on ["Russell"] around 5 PM or any time of day on ["Richards Blvd"] Boulevard under the train tracks near the ["Bike tunnels" bike tunnel].
 * Bicycles.  There are a lot of them, and you have to watch out for them.  Thankfully, the system of ["Bike Paths"] in Davis is excellent, and works better than the road system.
 * Pedestrians -- are three points each.  Bikes are only two. :)  Pedestrians are generally only a problem while driving in the neighborhood near ["Cafe Roma"].

As a consequence of all of these problems, it is best to follow a simple rule: the shortest distance between any two points in Davis isn't a straight line -- it's a bicycle.

There are also a few good ideas, such as the ["Bike Signal"] on Russell.  Remember, the bikes get to go first, when you're traveling on Sycamore.  There's a little bike symbol in the lights.
