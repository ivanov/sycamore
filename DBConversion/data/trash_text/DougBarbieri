Doug Barbieri lives in ["Oak Shade"], and works in Folsom at Serious Magic (http://www.seriousmagic.com). A bit of a commute, but hey, it's a good company (and it's work, too).

A C++ programmer, he writes code for Windows and Linux (and will make his foray into the Mac world soon). Check out his open source project at http://vncselector.sf.net. More happy stuff will appear here later. :-)
