Judy Sakaki is the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs.  I'm not sure what this entails, but she'll probably pay more attention to you than, say, ["Stan Nosek"], who's in charge of administration.  Her office is in 476 Mrak Hall.

Sakaki is also the administration go-to person on issues of ["Cow Tipping" cow tipping].

Judy will send you a card before your 21st birthday telling you not to die because it makes the ["UC Davis" University] look bad.

''She didn't send me a card. :(  Which is too bad, since that was a point in my life where I really wanted to die.'' -["BrentLaabs"]
