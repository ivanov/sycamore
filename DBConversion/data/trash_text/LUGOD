In the words of [http://lugod.org their website], "''The Linux Users' Group of Davis is a 501(c)(7) non-profit computer club serving Davis, California and the Sacramento area. We are a collection of over 400 people dedicated to GNU/Linux ^TM^ (a powerful, free, Unix-like operating system), Free Software, Open Source, and other related topics.''"

=== The version with fewer buzzwords ===

LUGOD has about 100 active members, and meeting attendance anywhere in the 10 to 60 range, depending on the topic.  Many travel from outside Davis to attend, and a far smaller percentage of members are students than you might expect.  Not surprisingly, it includes a fair swath of Davis' sysadmin population.  They work to promote Linux among the town's population, including but not limited to the student population.  They maintain active mailinglists and a semi-active IRC channel (''#lugod'') on [http://freenode.net/ FreeNode.net].

==== Activities of note to residents ====

 *Their meetings (http://www.lugod.org/meetings) are held twice a month, usually at the Davis public library, but sometimes in an alternate location such as ["Kemper Hall"] at UC Davis.
 *Together with the Computer Club at UC Davis, they back monthly Linux ''installfest'' workshops (http://www.lugod.org/if), usually held on campus, at which people have Linux installed on their systems by volunteers (aka ''trained monkeys'').  They are actually running sort of short of these aforementioned trained monkeys and would love more volunteers (email if@lugod.org if you would like to help).  More information at http://www.lugod.org/if/help. 
 *They occasionally hold hands-on demos (http://www.lugod.org/projects/demos/) at locations like ["The Co-Op"], so that people who haven't tried Linux yet can take it for a test drive. Freebies and informative handouts are often given out at these events.
 *They helped construct the ["Public Internet Terminals" public internet terminals] at ["Newsbeat"] and ["The Co-Op"] (which are maintained by ["DCN" the Davis Community Network] and Omsoft).  They put one together for ["Chamonix"], but then they changed owners and it went away.
