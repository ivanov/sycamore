The graffiti bridge is a wonder that can be located a few miles west of ["Davis"] off of ["Russell"] Blvd.  It lies on Country Road 95A in ["Yolo County"], but it is known as Stevenson Bridge Road on the ["Solano County"] side.  Love messages, insults, and downright creepy messages can be found scrawled across the entire span of bridge.  Not a nook is uncovered leaving spectators wondering what the original color of the bridge is.

||<^>[[BR]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]]The bridge is home to ["California Aggie Marching Band-Uh" fugitive band geeks], bicylers every morning, people making strange commutes, kids drinking ["forty" forties], bikers, lots of old ["In-N-Out"] garbage, a trashed car, a ton of old metal scraps, ["Town Flora" trees], a quiet creek, a nice smell (sort of) a good morning walk, a ["Good Ideas For Dates" great date], Sheridan & Alexis' love, and a cute path. [[BR]][[BR]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]]The bridge spans the meager ["Putah Creek"] which lies about a hundred feet below.  ["Bicycling" Bicyclers] and people making strange commutes pass through here every morning.  The bridge in the morning is a truly magical thing.||attachment:be_lame.jpg||

On the creek's banks lies all sorts of oddities:

In 2004 a photoshoot for the softcore pornography website [http://suicidegirls.com suicidegirls.com] occured at the bridge.  The name of the girl (on the site) is "Absinthe."  The exact details are of course unknown, but she poses all around, showing off the elegant graffiti of the bridge (and her breasts).

A nice poem featuring the bridge is aptly named [http://www.terrain.org/poetry/15/redding.htm Bridge].

There is a cool picture of a BMW on this bridge in [http://forums.bimmerforums.com/forum/showthread.php?t=178598 this thread] on the Bimmerforums.
