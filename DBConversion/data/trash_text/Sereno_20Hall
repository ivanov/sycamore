Sereno Hall is located in the ["Regan"] dorms.  It is the "Music, Arts, and Performance" Themed Dorm, or just simply the "Music Dorm". Some also call it the Sereno Insane Asylum.  It's a rockin' place even if the facilities themselves are really old and kind of poor.  It's a small dorm housing around 50 individuals which makes for a close-knit environment with a strong sense of camaraderie. 

As a graduate of Sereno I credit most of my life's accomplishments to the hours spent running crazy through these halls.  Sereno '03-'04 was a good year.  Sereno for LIFE!!!! - ["TimOldenkamp"]

As a periodic presence in Sereno, I can attest that, certainly, Sereno is responsible for most of ["TimOldenkamp" Mr. Oldenkamp's] behavior, but I do not believe that any one source can account for the full "personality" with which he presents us. - ["ChristopherCondap"]
