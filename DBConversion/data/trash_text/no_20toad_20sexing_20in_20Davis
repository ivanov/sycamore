='no toad sexing' in Davis=
by ["DanMasiel"]

{{{One fine evening, Larry and I were bored, broke and didn't want to do our homework. We decided it would be
interesting to attempt to penetrate the mysterious depths of the buildings on campus. Before class that day I
noticed an unlocked ventilation grate that seemed to lead to a tunnel. We set out from the Malcom dormitory 
and headed towards Olson Hall. The unlocked grate outside seemed to lead to noting but a dark hole, so we 
opted to explore the interior of the building instead. 

Once inside we walked downstairs to the basement. We soon discovered a door that hadn't been closed completely.
Inside was a dimly lit concrete room full of pipes, wires, and boxes. At first the room didn't appear to be
that large, but after further inspection we discovered the entrance to a long tunnel at the back of the room.
We had set out, bored and not really expecting to find anything interesting. The sight of what appeared to be 
a 100 meter long tunnel left us dumbfounded. The tunnel was approximately a meter wide and three meters tall
with pipes running along the ceiling. It was well lit and we immediately walked through it. On the other side
was a huge room. Half of the room was filled with boxes of old student records enclosed by a huge wire cage.
We wandered around the room for a while and found an elevator.

We got into the elevator and noticed that there were 9 floors in the building. Upon realizing that we were 
in the basement of Sproul Hall, we were overcome with a feeling of immense satisfaction and a growing sense
that nothing could stop us on this adventure. Larry pressed the 9 button and we soon found ourselves in a 
hallway full of offices. We wandered around a looked out the windows. We then entered the stairwell, and 
before us stood something we could not refuse. A small metal staircase stretched out over the spiraling 
stairwell and ended at a hatch to the roof. There appeared to be a lock hanging from the handle of the 
hatch, but I decided to check it anyway. To my amazement the lock was not closed and the hatch was easily
opened.

Larry and I climbed out the hatch and emerged near a bunch of communications equipment on roof. The view 
was incredible. Essentially all of Davis was laid out before us. After enjoying the view for a while we
climbed back through the hatch and walked back to the elevator. We pressed the basement button but 
received no response from the machine. Thinking we had accomplished quite enough for one night, we took 
the elevator to the bottom floor and walked victoriously back to the dorms.}}}

''2004-12-09 17:47:24'' [[nbsp]] Awesome story.  I've been through the Sproul-Olson underground passage, but I have yet to climb to the roof. - ["MikeIvanov"]------
''2004-12-09 22:10:54'' [[nbsp]] Awesome,  I too have explored the tunnels under sproul -- though I'm prepared to deny that upon questioning by disciplinary authorities (lets apply the disclaimer in the emosnail userinfo to this).  You really lucked out with all the doors unlocked.  There also is a tunnel between ["Kerr Hall" Kerr] and ["Wellman Hall" Wellman] which I've seen on floor schematics but never explored. - ["KrisFricke"]

''2004-12-09 23:21:41'' [[nbsp]] Kris:  The tunnel between Kerr and Wellman is far less exciting, simply a passage between the basements.  It is usually locked from the Wellman side, but you can always get from Kerr to Wellman.  Professors use this tunnel all the time in the rainy season. - ["BrentLaabs"]------
''2004-12-09 23:46:13'' [[nbsp]] I wish ''I'' had a tunnel to campus to use when it rained - ["KrisFricke"]

''2004-12-10 02:17:30'' [[nbsp]] I hear that the tunnel from Kerr to Wellman is useful if you want to sneak into Wellman late at night to watch DVD's on the big screen with auditorium seating.  Of course, this is only good if you can get into Kerr. - ["ZachSaul"]------
''2004-12-10 07:36:27'' [[nbsp]] And what's even better is, you could sneak into wellman late at night and play Halo 2 on the projection screens with several x-boxes networked on the campus LAN - ["DanMasiel"]
