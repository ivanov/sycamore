Student Action is one of the slates that ran for ["ASUCD"] positions in the past.  One candidate who was a ["Senate" senator] on this ticket was ["Lamar Heystek"], who has since run for ["Davis City Council"].

The name is stolen from a party for Berkeley's [http://www.asuc.org/ ASUC].  The Berkeley slate still has this name, as shown in [http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~election/senate-2004.html election results] from 2004.
