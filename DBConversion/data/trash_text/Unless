'''History:'''
The first incarnation of Unless was formed in maybe 1999 at UC Davis. The group, then called Excruciating Excruciating (Ex ex), was composed of Joe Conte, Dan Young, and a varying cast of other dudes. Parallel to Unless is ["You See Davis Hardcore"] (online at [http://www.ysdhc.com]), a website and forum for local university students interested in hardcore music. The band members are closely affiliated with Davis Music Scene, and the group's efforts are largely responsible for the recent rebirth and visibility of hardcore at UC Davis.
