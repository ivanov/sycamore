Pete Hernandez is a candidate with ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"] and is the only vegan on the slate, though #1 candidate ["Rob Roy"] is a vegetarian.  Pete actually ran for ["Senate"] last quarter (Fall 2004) in an unsuccessful yet awesome campaign (as he told everyone to "Vote for Pedro" and he promised to make all their wildest dreams come true.)

He has experience serving on the senate of his community college's student association, which means he knows how the [http://caag.state.ca.us/publications/2003_Intro_BrownAct.pdf California Brown Act] applies to ["ASUCD"].  But he's not likely to overemphasize his experience at JC, unlike another person who many of us know.


He is a part time musician and a employee at ["Mishka's"], Pete also volunteers some of his time for animal rights.

Caretaker of ["Marcus Shellshock"] 

He lives at ["2500 Loyola"] which is often confused with the other ["Loyola House"] with ["Jesse Miller"] and ["Jeff Wurz"]
