Also known as the Med Sci Cafe.  They sell Starbucks coffee, some pastries, and light breakfast foods.  They have a grill that serves standard sandwiches and burgers, along with sides of fries or chips. There is also a Tex-Mex Grill which serves Quesadillas, tacos, and other mexican food.  The food is okay, but not as good as what is at the ["Coffee House"].  

It is a nice place to see hot doctors.
