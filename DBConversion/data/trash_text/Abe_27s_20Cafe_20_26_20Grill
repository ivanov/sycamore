A diner style restaurant.

''2005-01-28 10:34:36'' [[nbsp]] I went once for a late dinner, and it was one of the most terrible restaurant experiences I've ever had.  The food, service and cleanliness of the place were all terrible.  I like diners, but this one won't get a repeat visit unless a bunch of people say that my experience was a fluke. --["JabberWokky"]------
''2005-01-28 11:30:13'' [[nbsp]] I've eaten at Abe's half a dozen times or so, right after they first opened.  The food and service seemed adequate to me for a diner style place.  For a while I was in the habit of grabbing their breakfast special for take-out after working all night.  My experiences were decent, but not good enough to keep me coming back long-term.  I was also turned off when they made a big hassle about serving me alcohol on picnic day despite me having a valid CA ID.  I haven't eaten there in at least a year. --["JevanGray"]
