The [http://wef.ucdavis.edu Whole Earth Festival] aka WEF is a huge three day music and education fest in the Spring (usually takes place during Mother's Day Weekend). Definitely a must-see Davis event.  Tons of folks who are hardcore about saving the earth make a pilgrimage to Davis for this very event, and the UC Davis ["The Quad" Quad] area is littered with hundreds of craft huts, music acts, massage tables, food and a child care area.  Various workshops occur throughout the weekend as well. Of all the festivals that take place on campus, this one is one of the most organized.  Volunteering is quite the experience, plus you get a free shirt if you do.

The next Festival is May 6, 7 & 8, 2005. Volunteers should meet in the MU's King Lounge at 7PM on Wednesday May 4.
If you want a booth or your band wants to play, January is the month to contact WEF. The WEF office is located in 260 South ["Silo"] and shares an office with the ["Experimental College"]. The Chairs of WEF this year are Mike Nolan and ["DJ Tao" Tao Wysocki].

== Unique things to check out ==

 * Every year a man comes with a cart full of "Peace" pendants that he gives out for free. He never stays in the same place at the festival. He makes hundreds of pendants each year and he's expanded his collection to include the word "Peace" in other languages. Keep an eye out for him.
 * Chocolate covered frozen fruit. Enough said.
 * Beach Hair Accessories; there's a woman that collects metal beach trash and makes it into fine jewelry and hair accesories. A little pricey, but well worth the lifetime warranty. If you break anything that you buy from her, all you have to do is send it back and she'll weld it again for you!
 * The Recyling and Composting effort is very successful. In 2004, only 420lb (3.5%) of  waste went to the landfill. The rest was recycled or composted.
 * Most people do not realize that every item that is thrown away at WEF is eventually dumped onto a large table and sorted by a volunteer. While this may not sound like an appealing idea at first, it is actually one of the most entertaining and coveted volunteer positions. Try it out, it may be the only time you get to legally go through someones trash and you might even find a ["groundscore"]. It's amazing what some people throw away.
 * The dish system is like no other. When you buy food, you pay an extra dollar for the plate. To get you dollar back, you return the dish to one of the 2 dish return sites on either side of the quad.
 * There's usually a rave type thing in ["Wellman Hall"] that is put on by some WEF folks.

This cool ["Whole Earth Bench" bench] was made during the 2004 Whole Earth Festival.

The ["Students for an Orwellian Society"] attended last year, attempting to convince everyone at the Festival that they should avoid drugcrime and sexcrime.  As expected, the response was less than enthusiastic.  However, it's quite amusing to see an Orwellian trying to convince a hippie that fascism is the way to go for more than half an hour.

''2004-12-11 19:12:53'' [[nbsp]] The WEF was originally a art class project. They used to have a LOT of free stuff going on in the booths during the Seventies, but now it's devolved into more or less a holistic arts and crafts fair, where most booths are about making a profit. That said, it's still a fun festival (often held on Mother's Day weekend) and students and non-students alike should attend at least once. - ["CentralDavisite"]

''2004-12-19 16:07:43'' [[nbsp]] WEF is actually a Non Profit itself. The booths do make a bit of cash, but the folks who are selling the crafts are mostly familes who need such income to support themselves, as this is all they do. This is completely different than any usual holistic arts and crafts faire. this is the first festival of the spring and a lot of these folks have been strapped for income for months by the time they get out the UCD quad. I would think it is more of an educational event, educating all on an alternative lifestyle witha  focus on lessing our communal impact on the earth in a variety of ways through our everyday actions...  - ["CompostNolan"]
