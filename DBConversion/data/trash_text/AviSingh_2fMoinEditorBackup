Thank you for checking out my page on the wiki!  I am a third year political science and philosophy major.  Currently, I serve as President of the Davis College Democrats and spend my time at UC Davis as an advocate for political discourse and engagement.  I am also active in city politics as a member of the City of Davis Social Services Commission.  I recently decided to run for ASUCD Senate as an Independent candidate so that I can use my experience in local government and campus politics to serve UC Davis students.

ASUCD is at a critical stage.  In the face of Senate resignations and the growing general apathy towards the campus political process, we students have a choice about the direction of ASUCD.  Either we can embrace the status quo and continue and watch our student government decline (while it continues to collect our ASUCD fees) or we can head in a new direction.  I want to serve the interests of the students by guiding ASUCD in a positive direction so that the services provided by student government develop a strong sense of community on campus and in the city of Davis.

As a political activist, I worked with other campus parties to sponsor a political debate on SB 60.  In coordinating this debate, I co-sponsored a Senate bill with Donald Cohen-Cutler and Keith Shively to direct ASUCD funds towards enhancing the political environment of UC Davis.  I will focus on developing a political environment as a Senator in order to enhance the quality of campus life for UC Davis students.

I am running as an Independent because I believe the slate process, generally, has been detrimental to student government's ability to serve the student community.  I am running as a representative for all students and will be responsible to all students.  I am running to establish accountability and maintain the prominent position of UC Davis as a leader.

I appreciate your support in my efforts and I appreciate any suggestions or insight that you may offer.
