With so many people coming and going from this town, there will always be a large population of single people. Almost every day, some ["Media" columnist] whines about how they aren't getting any action. Depending on what your style is, the right person could be anywhere. Only the desperate can be found searching at ["meat market" meat markets] or other random ["Spots And Places" spots]. Once you find someone you better have some ["Good Ideas For Dates" good ideas for dates].
