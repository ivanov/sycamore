All buses are equiped with ["Bicycles" bike] racks.  They're actually pretty simple to use.  Make sure the driver sees you and knows you're about to step in front of the bus when you go to load your bike.

= Tips =

 * From Davis, Bus 42A is the most direct route to the Sacramento Airport (SMF) (42B back to Davis)  It takes about an hour, including the dead time at County Fair Mall (the driver gets a smoke break there or something).  42 Clockwise (42 A) picks up at the MU depot and proceeds up Anderson, just like the Unitrans G line, before leaving Davis.  To get back, take 42 Counter-clockwise (42 B); pick it up at a "public transportation" bus stop, across the street from baggage claim at SMF (Sacto Intergalactic) terminals A and B.
 * From Davis, 42B is most direct for Old Town Sacramento / Downtown Sacramento (42A back to Davis)
   * (You'd think since the map shows the 42 route running in a circuit you could take either way, but there's usually some sort of bus switch before any one driver makes a full circuit. Since they don't expect people to get from the Airport to Davis by way of Sacramento, you could easily end up stranded there when your driver goes off duty. Make sure to take the right direction unless you want to be waiting around outside the Downtown Plaza mall for a new bus.)
 * The 220 Line can get you to the shopping area of Vacaville, but it only runs 3-4 times per day, so you'd have to plan
