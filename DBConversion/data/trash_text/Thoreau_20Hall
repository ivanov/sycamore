Thoreau Hall is located in the ["Cuarto"] resident area just off campus. It was the newest of the dorms until Segundo North opened its doors in September 2003. It was constructed in 1989 on the site of a former barn. Thoreau's first floor and lobby are home to the Thoreau Area Service Desk, the Cuarto general office, the Cuarto Coordinator offices, and the two year-old Cuarto Academic Advising Center (also know as the CuAAC, or "quack"). There are three floors to Thoreau, each with about 8 suites or so. Each suite houses approximately 8 people. During the housing crunch of years past, the rooms would be filled with 10 people or so. Thoreau Hall is a quiet place but overall a nice dorm to live in.
