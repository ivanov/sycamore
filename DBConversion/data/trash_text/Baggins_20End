Baggins End is the name of the area where ["The Domes"] are located.  It is a reference to Bag End, home of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins in ["The Hobbit"] and ''The Lord of the Rings'' by J.R.R. Tolkien.  Elsewhere in town, (e.g., in East Davis,) there are several other Tolkien references in the street names.
