Absolute Cellular is located at the corner of 5th and F. They sell AT&T/Cingular ["Cellular Phone" phones] and plans as well as Dish Network satellite TV service. 

UCD Students get a discount (10-15%, I believe) on phones. With this discount, their prices can be slightly better than other shops in Davis, though still higher than online and SF Chinatown stores. Of course, that's the price you pay for convenience.

''During my limited experience with the store the owner, Michael Hair, was very courteous and seemed fairly knowledgeable.'' -["AndrewChen"]

''Yeah, Michael Hair was really helpful when I was trying to do all kinds of fancy things with Smartphones (so to speak).  He is a UC Davis alumnus, and also a currently graduate student.  He appears to employ several hot girls.'' -["JaimeRaba" jr]

''Unfortunately, the chick I saw didn't know everything and couldn't help me out with my phone problems.  I guess it's best to go to Hair if you want more than the basic phone shpiel.'' - ["MarieHuynh"]

''Yeah, that's pretty much true at all phone stores.  They all seem to have one or two people who knows phones and the rest a pretty salespeople.  Not to stereotype, I must admit I've also seen some fairly ugly salespeople who are useless too.'' -["JaimeRaba" jr]
