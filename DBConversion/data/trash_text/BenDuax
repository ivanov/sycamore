''Ben in ["KDVS"], mid 2002''

Ben Duax is the high school dropout son of UC Davis Communications professor Paul Duax. Ironically Ben’s mother is also an educator. Ben is by no means a moron, although he may seem socially incompetent to the uninitiated. He is one of the most popular, and infamous, people in this town, bridging the divides between crusty townies, college kids, and pubescent miscreants. 

He has had a show on ["KDVS"] since he was 14 years old, and is an artist of the most decadent post-modern breed. He was posting cryptic flyers in town long before the ["Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion"] or ["SOSSS"]. ["RobRoy"] coined the term ["Duaxian Art"] in reference to the computer printer litter Ben staples to telephone poles. Ben also has poetic inclinations and has performed admirably at ["Delta of Venus"]'s venue.


Having matured under the tutelage of the legendary Donkey Flybye and others at KDVS in the late-90s, Ben's musical and artistic tastes developed rapidly toward the pleasantly-obscene grandiloquence in evidence today. He recently created a four-hour feedback loop by re-routing KDVS' compressed on-air transmission over the live airwaves. In addition to the widely-recognized Duxian telephone pole art, Ben has performed a noise routine at the Davis Art Center and been an integral, if iconoclastic, member of several lust and slander-driven musical projects based in Davis' high school population. Private meditations on Ben's future artistic possibilities send lubricious shivers of guilty anticipation through even the most pious and reactionary members of the Davis gentry. 


Although only 18 years old, Ben deserves to be on the ["Davis Mount Rushmore"].

Rumor also has it that today's incarnation of Mr. Duax may have been, at least in part, shaped by a dosing of acid administered clandestinely at a junior high party in 1998.
