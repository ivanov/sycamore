'''Free Community Advertising''' is advertising that you can do when you don't have any money.  Many important groups and events are advertised for by just posting things around and word of mouth.

Some ideas:
 * Flyers- check out ["Wiki Flyer"]
 * Mailing lists - ["SPAC"] has a list of student group contacts.  On-topic solicitations only please.
 * Chalking - Waking up super early and going into ["Wellman Hall" Wellman] and ["Olson Hall" Olson] to write messages on the chalkboards is likely worth it.  These messages (if placed properly on the inactive areas of the chalkboards) usually stay up for weeks.  There are some rules regarding chalking -- what are they?  Can only ["SPAC"] groups post on these boards? -- I can help make one of those fancy looking chalkboarding screens if anyone is interested, getting me up at 6am might prove more of a challenge. - ["DanMasiel"] You should do this Dan! - ["JackHaskel"]
 * Leafletting- people often hand out quarter sheets at the ["Memorial Union"].
 * Newspapers
 * Television
 * Radio - You can get a public service announcement on ["KDVS"] (check the [http://kdvs.org official site] for info or just go down there)
 * [http://Sacramento.CraigsList.org] -- a truly amazing community based free classifieds search

''While flyer and quartersheets might be printed out for free by abusing some campus department's printer, someone really need to include more details about advertising on newspapers and television for free.'' - ["PanSola"]
