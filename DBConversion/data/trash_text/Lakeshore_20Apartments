The Lakeshore apartment complex is a well-maintained and comfortable living environment.  The units are three-story high peach and mauve colored apartments with 1, 2, and 3 bedroom floorplans available.  The apartments themselves are very spacious, with wide, open rooms and balconies/patios.  The back side of the property, facing Stonegate Lake, is bordered by several "cottage" units, single-story apartments with back lawns and beautiful lake views.  The cottages tend to have a much lower turnover rate than the rest of the complex.  

The complex offers direct access to the lake; a swimming pool, hot tub, and fountain; a large clubhouse with pool tables and big screen TV; a small gym; one large laundry room, and a computer lab with both Dell and Mac computers.  

Although the majority of the apartments are filled by college students, there are also some families, older couples, and elderly people, which makes for a slightly quieter complex than many in Davis.  There is a pretty nice sense of community here, and the management goes out of there way to make residents feel at home.  All work orders are addressed promptly and professionally.

The complex is located out in West Davis, about a 15 minute bike or bus ride from campus.  There is a Unitrans "D" line stop directly across from the complex, and the "P/Q" line stop is just one block away.  The Westgate Plaza, located directly across the street, has a full grocery store, a great Mexican food restaurant, a dry cleaners, Lampost Pizza, a Chinese food restaurant, Curves fitness center, Suds laundromat, and a video store/U.S. post office/espresso bar.  It's a short drive or bike ride to the Marketplace on the other side of Hwy 113 for even more shopping opportunities.
