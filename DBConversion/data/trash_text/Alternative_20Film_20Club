AFC was started by former ["Campus Cinema"] employee & movie buff James Hirsh during Fall of 2002. After Hirsh's graduation the club was run by ["Rob Roy"] and others in the ["Pirate Ship"], this club used to meet every Wednesday in Wellman 2 where they would show "alternative films."  There has been little mention of its activity as of late but we can always hope the club will pop up again. The [http://alternativefilmclub.tripod.com/ Alternative Film Club] has exposed many a student to all sorts of cool, entertaining films.

Recently, ["SPAC"] has added to its forms a question if you are going to show a film or not. And if you do what is the purpose. And most importantly: do you have permission to show the film. Have you contacted the people who own the copyright? So, this said, the Alternative Film Club is not likely to be revived.

Here's a list of movies screened at AFC:
 * Meet the Feebles - Directed by Peter Jackson, best described as the Muppets on Crack
