Kerr Hall is located on the west side of the Quad, between ["Wellman Hall"] and ["Wickson Hall"].  It houses the offices of the ["Mathematics"] department, Statistics department, and ["Davis Honors Challenge"].

There is an undergraduate ["Computer Labs" computer lab] in room 457 on the 4th floor with 29 Linux terminals and a fast laser printer.  You must have a permanent or temporary account to use this lab.

A cool thing about Kerr Hall is the tunnel that connects it to the basement of ["Wellman Hall"].  There is, however, a lock on the door between them.  The trick is that this lock is one-way, and you can always enter Wellman from Kerr, if you happen to be in Kerr when Wellman is locked up.

If you're ever in need to fight a medieval war on campus, Kerr would be an ideal location to set up a defensive front.

This sundial is officially known as Meyer Sundial.||
