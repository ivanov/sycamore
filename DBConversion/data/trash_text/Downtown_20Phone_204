Current phone is pictured below:[[BR]][[BR]]attachment:fixed_phone.jpg [[BR]][[BR]]As of 2004-11-01, the phone looked very friendly, and even had a sticker telling everyone walking by "you are beautiful" (all photos pictured left).  However, the phone looked like it had been shattered or otherwise broken.  It still gave a dial tone, though.  Sometimes talking with a mouth piece in one hand and an ear piece in the other can be exciting.[[BR]][[BR]]'''Charge:''' 50 cents for local calls[[BR]][[BR]]'''you are beautiful:''' it's true.||
