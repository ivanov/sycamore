Freshman Fifteen - When breakfast, lunch AND dinner are buffet style, some students add on a layer of fat to prepare themselves for the near future when they'll have to move out of the dorms and cook for themselves.  At schools with higher standards of cuisine, they tend to refer to the "Freshman Twenty."

Davis isn't exactly the best school for gaining weight, what with all the ["Bicycles" biking] freshman are forced to undergo (or, if you prefer, walking).

''2005-01-26 14:54:39'' [[nbsp]] I gained over 15 pounds in my first two quarters here.  I lost it all, and then some, the following summer when I had to fend for myself in ["720"]. --["RishiTrivedi"]

''2005-01-26 18:28:49'' [[nbsp]] I actually lost weight after moving in as a Freshman, as I frequently found myself forgetting to eat before they closed.  This was not helped by the position of my room in the dorms, where exactly no one would walk past it on their way to the Dining Commons.  If you come from a home where food is constantly available 24 hours, and you have an odd activity cycle that makes you naturally eat at strange times, it takes some work to remind yourself when to eat DC food. --["ScottRitchie"]------
''2005-01-26 22:32:53'' [[nbsp]] I thought the food was so disgusting (I found a ladybug in my salad once) and that the Recreation Hall was so great... I ended up getting the Freshman negative eighteen... and have stayed the same weight since. I think part of it was that I never ate the main dishes and stuck with salads, and a lot of times I wouldn't have time to eat before they closed. --["AbbyLawson"]
