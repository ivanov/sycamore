The ["UC Davis" University] clearly contributes a great deal to the ["Davis" City's] ethnic diversity.

= Commentary =
''I'm not 100% sure why being ethnically diverse is so important.  This town happened to be founded in northern California at the turn of the century and, like most such towns, is mostly white with a growing hispanic and asian component.  There's a decided spin to the comments that accompany these numbers that implies that this is a bad thing.  Discrimination due to racism is bad, which is what this appears to be... are you saying we should have all "those white folk" run out of town?  Or do you support the forced moving of people to Davis based on race to satisfy your sense of what is "right"?  How about just enjoying your neighbors regardless of their color rather than trying to "collect a full set"?  Or how about just making this a factual page, with a different page for racism issues and hate crime (which does happen here)?'' -- ["JabberWokky" jw]  [[BR]]

 * I know a many people that grew up in Davis and I notice them having a lot of racist tendencies. I'm from ["Sacramento"] which is, according to TIME magazine, the most ethnically diverse city in America. Davis wants people to think it is so progressive but it is really a lily-white racist facade. When hate crime happens in this town I am not surprised. Evolution is best when ethnicities mingle. My main point is that without the university Davis would hardly be diverse. I would be even worse than what the statistics show because even less professors of ethnic backgrounds would live here. Davis may project the idea of them being the perfect progressive all American city but there is a reason why a picket fence and a Klansman’s robe are the same color. -["RobRoy"]

   * ''I'm from the deep South.  When Davis has the KKK channel on basic cable, when I get beaten openly and repeatedly at Gay '''Rights''' protests (as opposed to Gay '''Pride''' Day) downtown, when I have to volunteer (as a large man) as an escort to physically protect women trying to go to abortion clinics... then we'll talk about Davis having a "lily-white racist facade".  There are issues here, and racism is one of them.  Importing a rainbow won't make people hate each other any less.  People like Bev do.  Human beings have a long history of ignorance and hate.  There is certainly room for improvement here in Davis.  But Davis does stand toward the top of the heap in terms of a accepting and welcoming community.  If you don't think so, I urge you to travel.''  -- ["JabberWokky" jw]
