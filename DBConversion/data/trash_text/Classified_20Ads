''Perhaps we can banish classified ads entirely?Wiki is probably a pretty difficult format for these. -- ["KenBloom"]''

''I agree, Davis Swap is a much better place for classifieds.'' --["MikeIvanov"]

''Uhm yeah, summer, i think you're outvoted on this one. see ["Free Community Advertising"]'' -- ["ArlenAbraham"]

''I don't see a real problem with the ads, as long as they don't take up a huge amount of pages.  I use it for promotion of other things, like ["Slate" slates]. I dissent.'' -- ["BrentLaabs"]

''I don't think the pages should have been deleted, but I didn't reinstate them.  One of my roommates did not realizing I had loged in on her computer.  She talked to ["PhilipNeustrom"] about it, though, who said there is no really good classified resource in the Davis Community and saw no reason not to try it.  All it takes is structure, and, really, the wiki is an ideal place to make an attempt.  Ads that are offensive or corporate could be edited.  Once the ad has served it's purpose, it's erased.  Ultimately, it would be nice to have, but if it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out.  Regardless, it's rude to delete pages, especially without giving the idea a try.  And seriously, wiki is all about advertising--whether it's your house, yourself, your political aspirations (what is campaigning if not advertising?), your favorite place to eat, your friends--every time you make a page you make an advertisement''. -- ["SummerSong"]
  * No, I don't think the purpose of the wiki is to advertise.  The purpose is to provide information.  Personal and subjective information that is informative can find a home here, but that doesn't mean that ["Rob Roy for Senate"] belongs to ["Rob Roy"], or that ["Ali Baba"] belongs to the Ali Baba people.  A page about a topic can provide a place for information about it as well as discussion.  Regardless, I don't care either way about Classifieds.
  * The purpose of the wiki is information not advertising. People should work more towards this goal. There remains lots of Davis knowledge out there that has not been put down yet. Personally, I don't care at all about people's houses and such. - ["JackHaskel"]
