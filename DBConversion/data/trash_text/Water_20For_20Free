Often found fighting jocks, Water For Free has gained noteriety as being Davis' only "Ultra Rock-Star" band.  At first we all though it was just scream-o, but it turned out that this ["Dixon" Dixonian] 4 piece had MTV2 aspirations.  Fronted by ["Cafe Roma" Cafe Roma's] most welcoming employee (and ex ["Bunny House"] resident) ["DeanONeil" Dean O Neil], Water For Free is this area's most sought after group, and when their e.p. is finally dropped on us, we will all understand the mighty beast that is this band.
