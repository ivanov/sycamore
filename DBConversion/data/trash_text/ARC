The ARC is one mother of a huge building that expands upon the existing ["Rec Hall"] (now formally called "The Pavilion at ARC", but no one actually calls it that, because the word Pavilion is generally accepted as lame).

In addition to a plethora of exercise equipment, the ARC also features weights, raquet ball courts, a climbing wall, an indoor track, an obscenely large basketball court, meeting rooms, a ballroom, a practice area for the ["Band-Uh"], a small computer lab, a branch of the bookstore, and a cafe run by ["Sodexho"].


Some of the equimpent that they offer: MANY elipticals, treadmills, a few stair climbers, some arc walking machines, and stationary bikes (what is the point of doing the stationary bike in Davis anyway??).  They feature an indoor walking/running track that is much better than what the former ["Rec Hall"] had. They also have some racketball courts. If you need equipment you can check it out right there which is a nice plus.

The ARC is a prime example of a ["meat market"] as many students go to the ARC just to look good in front of other students.

Over by the ballroom, there are some of the ["Cleanest Bathrooms"] on campus.  It could be because they are new, have nice countertops, or the music, but they are definitely nicer than most.
