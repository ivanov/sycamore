''I once had a clutch cable replaced on my dad's '93 SAAB 900 by these guys. They didn't remount the transmission correctly and it fell out the bottom of the car (held in by a single mounting bracket) while I was driving on the freeway. They fixed the transmission for free, but they neglected to fix or inform me of a slew of other problems that would have been blatantly obvious to any other SAAB mechanic (i later took the car to another mechanic). The head guy there was also rude to me. I don't know if they were giving me crap because I was a student or what, but my experience with G & R was not a plesant one.'' -- ["ArlenAbraham"]
