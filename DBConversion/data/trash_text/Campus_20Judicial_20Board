= Introduction =
The UC Davis Campus Judicial Board, or CJB for short, is a University body which has the primary responsibility of hearing and deciding cases of contested student misconduct. CJB "proper" usually consists of 12 student members and 4 faculty members. The student members are appointed under the authority of the Vice Chancellor of ["Student Affairs"], but are typically selected through an interview and recruitment process conducted by the current/outgoing student members and the CJB Staff Advisor (who is an SJA officer). The faculty members of the Board are appointed by the ["Academic Senate"] and serve on the Board for 2 year periods (IIRC). Because their mission and purpose is closely related to the duties of the Office of ["Student Judicial Affairs"], the two groups often work side-by-side. The students of the Campus Judicial Board work out of the Office of ["Student Judicial Affairs"] in ["Dutton Hall"]

= Duties =
CJB can also refer to simply the (12) student members, as they will meet and work together to conduct campus outreach programs in order to promote academic and social integrity amongst students. Other responsibilities of CJB students include serving as advisors or advocates for students or faculty who are going into formal hearings (for contested misconduct). CJB students also conduct follow-up meetings with students who have been through the informal disciplinary process to obtain valuable assessment information, as well as help faciliate a more comprehensive learning experience for students who have been referred for misconduct. Responsibilities and duties of CJB students have been known to vary, as well.

Typically, Campus Judicial Board hearings will be heard by a panel consisting of 2 student members and 1 faculty member. One of the student members chairs the formal hearing. For more serious violations, hearings are brought before the ["Student Conduct Committee"], which is a body that has a slightly different mandate (and thus extended powers, such as dismissal and suspension). However, students who are appointed to CJB also receive a co-appointment to the SCC. One of the other ways ["Student Conduct Committee"] hearings differ from CJB hearings is that they typically (but not always) have a faculty majority (2) and student minority (1). SCC Hearings are chaired by a faculty member as well, usually a faculty member from the UC Davis Law School (["King Hall"]).

As of a few years ago, ["ASUCD"] ammended its Government Codes to include the Campus Judicial Board in its procedures. Complaints against the ["Elections Committee"], for example, are to be brought before the Campus Judicial Board. In recent years, this has happened on a few occasions: the so-called ["Election Statement Controversy"], as well as an issue regarding the ["Move to D1"] referendum in Winter 2002.

= History =
... Too much to say here. I'll save this for another time. The one thing I will for now is that the Campus Judicial Board has existed longer than Student Judicial Affairs has at UC Davis.
