Replacing Blimpy and ["Taco Bell"] is Jimboy's, a mexican restaurant that has several locations in the Sacramento regions.  It's fast mexican food, which makes for an option for folks who live on that side of town.  However, the reason many people go to fast food instead of a Taco Shop, is because of their late hours.  Jimboy's Davis location closes early.  Employees at this new Jimboy's (who apparently also worked there when it was a Blimpy) report that they save "quite a few more customers."  They also have a drive-thru.


''This has potential, but for now Guad and Adelbertos will suffice for me.  "Grilled" corn tortillas on tacos are very oily, and dumping dry cheese on the outside only makes it impossible to blot the oil off.  Most burrittos are fried.  Their latest commercials profess that all their options are Atkins friendly and have been "low carb" for over 20 years.  Or something.''-["JaimeRaba" jr]

''2005-01-20 14:23:06'' [[nbsp]] FYI, the dry cheese is parmesan, and its somewhat of a trademark feature for them. The story is that Jim accidently spilled some parmesan cheese when cooking some tacos. After cooking new tacos for the customers, Jim ate the "spoiled" tacos for his lunch. He was so impressed with the taste they have been adding the parmesan ever since. For whatever reason, Jimboy's has thrived in the Sacramento area... there being close to 30 locations locally. --["JevanGray"]
