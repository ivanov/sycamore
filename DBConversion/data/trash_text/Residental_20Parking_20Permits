Because of those lazy university faculty, students and staff who drive to ["Campus"], our Fair City has a residental parking permit program. Permits expire each September and are issued by the ["Davis Police Department"].

Zones are as follow:

Preferential Parking Permit Areas:
 * '''E''' 
 * '''H''' 
 * '''P''' 
 * '''Q''' 
 * '''R''' 
 * '''S''' -- Covers above West 8th between Anderson and B
 * '''U''' -- One of the more coveted permits, this covers from Anderson to B and from Russell to West 8th.
 * '''W''' 
 * '''X''' -- Downtown. Byfar the most soughafter parking permit.
