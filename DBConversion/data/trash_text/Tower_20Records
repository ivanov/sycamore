Tower Records is the ''lame'' corporate record store in town. Sure, they might have 30,000 CDs and 10,000 DVDs, but who doesn't these days? Used CDs, posters and magazines aren't exactly unique features either! Plus, they're in cahoots with those cronies over at Ticketmaster. Not to mention some of their employees are quite elitist and they ''always'' make you put your bag behind the counter! How lame. At ["Armadillo Music"] the employees are much friendlier and you can try out any CD in the store! Plus it's usually cheaper. The only good part about Tower Records is that Tom Waits has shopped there before, because his daughter goes to the University. Perhaps he just went there because he was afraid that all the cool people at Armadillo would recognize him but he knew the ''Lame-Os'' at Tower wouldn't!

Also, Michael Moore, when visiting Davis to speak at the ["Mondavi Center"], went to Tower and skipped out on ["Armadillo Music"].

The best reason to go to Tower is ["KristenBirdsall"]!

=== Apologia ===

I work at Tower. We're not lame, I promise. I actually think the employees there are pretty cool not to mention that the permanent employees are extremely knowledgeable about our respective genres. Also, Tom Waits does shop at Tower, he came in some time last summer and I recognized him and rang him up for a really awful David Banner CD ([http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:ow8zeflk3gf1 Mississippi: The Album]).  As for Tower being a lame chain store, it started in Sacramento several decades ago as a small store not quite unlike ["Armadillo Music"]. I'm a fan of Tower. - ["KristenBirdsall"]
