== Section Headings ==
You can create headings by starting and ending a line with up to five equal signs. The heading text is between those markers, separated by a single space.

Headings can be automatically numbered, you can enable this by putting {{{#pragma section-numbers on}}} as the first line of the page.

For more information on the possible markup, see ["Help On Editing"]. 

=== Example ===
{{{
 = Heading =
 == Subheading ==
 === Level 3 ===
 ==== Level 4 ====
 ===== Level 5 =====
}}} 

=== Display ===
 = Heading =
 == Subheading ==
 === Level 3 ===
 ==== Level 4 ====
 ===== Level 5 =====

Note that proper section numbering requires you to order sections according to a valid structure, i.e. correctly nested. Our sample doesn't do this, so you get a different numbering scheme than you might expect.

You'll want to use the biggest header, {{{= Big one =}}}, for creating your initial sections then smaller headers for sub-sections, accordingly.

To indent a headline just but a space (or multiple spaces) in front of it:

{{{
 == indented ==

== not indented ==
}}}

displays as:

 = indented =

= not indented =

This is useful for organizing headers.  The more spaces you put in front of a headline the more it's indented.
