Steve's makes a decent pizza, and also has pasta and salad bar.  They used to have more reasonable prices on non-pizza items, but their prices are still not bad.  They sometimes have good lunch specials, and they have seating that can accomidate large groups. They also have a small video game area.

...and they have the best croutons in town!  --["BevSykes"]

If you're looking to save some bucks and still get a lot of food, try getting ''just'' the cheesy bread (with sauce).  - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
