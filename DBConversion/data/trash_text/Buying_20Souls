Everyone has at least one weakness.  The point of the game is to find a weakness and use it to buy/barter for their soul.  

For example, ["ChadVanSchoelandt" person x] is ["Starbucks"]' frappuchinos' bitch.  We take a frappuchino, wave it in their face, and trade it for their soul.  Simple?  Not quite.  But it is amusing when you do succeed.

How many souls do YOU have?

''2004-12-14 00:18:44'' [[nbsp]] Incidently I bought two souls while in high school.  One for two peices of lined paper, one for one peice of graph paper.  The former was a rather attractive semigothic girl, the latter was a Jewish lad who claimed he didn't believe in souls and therefore laughed at my foolish attempt to buy nothing - shortly however he began to get nervious and tried to barter for it back which I found quite amusing.  He got really uneasy when he tried to buy mine and I responded with "what you tihnk I'm an idiot?!" - ["KrisFricke"]
