Little Prague is a Czech restaurant.  Maybe you've never had Czech food before, but don't be afraid -- it's just good, hardy food.  The ["Happy Hour Drink" happy hour] at Little Prague is a good deal, with tasty 24oz glasses of beer for three bucks, as well as 1/2 price appetizers like potato pancakes and deep-fried cauliflower.

However, the ambience isn't always so hospitable. Also be warned against getting suckered into buying shots of so-called absinthe. It's  horrendously expensive and no where near as strong as the real stuff.  They charge $7 per shot, even though the entire bottle of "Absente" can be gotten for $35 at Beverages and More.  There is also some argument as to whether even this pseudo-absinte is even legal to sell in the US, since there is an apparent ban on all wormwood-derived products, and "petite wormwood" from which this stuff is made is from the banned genus.

Little Prague is a bit pricey (it is, after all, a ["Trendy Restaurants" trendy restaurant]).
