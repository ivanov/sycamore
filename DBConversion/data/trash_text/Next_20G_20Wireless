Next G Wireless is in its third year serving the Davis community and is "''always offering the most competitive prices on  ["Cellular Phone" cell phones] and equipment anywhere in the area''". They say that their pricing is "''often identical or cheaper than available on letstalk.com or amazon.com and they are hundreds less than any other T-mobile retailer online or with a location''". Students get an "Accessory Value Package consisting of the car charger and leather case for their phone". 

Next G Wireless used to carry multiple companies but recently stopped providing Verizon service due to reception issues and AT&T because of the Cingular buyout. As an exclusive T-Mobile authorized agent they are able to offer camera phones with the purchase of a plan, Palms and Handhelds that go for for about $200 and are also able to activate ["WiFi Hot Spots" WiFi] accounts for use in Starbucks and other locations like Kinkos.
