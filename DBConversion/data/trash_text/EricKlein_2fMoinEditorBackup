Stemming from shows on ESPN, poker (especially texas hold 'em) has become increasingly popular. Poker playing had become so prevelant in the ["dorm" dorms] that at one point some ["freshmen"] were heard to be losing $50-100 a day in ["Thompson Hall"] in ["Segundo"]. Since then, flyers were posted mentioning the illegality of gambling, and ["Resident Advisors" RAs] were told to crack down on students playing poker for money.

Matty, not your fault:  it's ours.  We have a retarded 'blacklist' to get rid of 'spam' terms such as, well, poker (so people don't spam the place with links to poker sites..)  Anyway, I just removed the blacklist so it should work now.
