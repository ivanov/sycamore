Julie is a UC Davis student who is studying abroad in England at Royal Holloway, University of London.  While at UCD she is a member of the University Chorus and the UC Davis Chambers Singers.  She enjoys music, poetry, chatting on AIM, and keeping her LJ up to date.  She has myspace, but doesn't really like it.  She is also in the process of getting addicted to wikis.  Her favorite show is most likely Gilmore Girls, no one can keep her from talking about it.  Her wonderful friend Alison, recently got her "Gilmore Girls, The Complete First Season" for which she will be eternally grateful.  Julie is constantly having trouble as her flatmate keeps having loud sex next door, oh well!  At least he's having a good time.

In other news:  Julie will be peforming a small part in RHUL's production of "The Vagina Monologues"  There will be singing, and VERY minimal acting involved. (which is fine by her!)
