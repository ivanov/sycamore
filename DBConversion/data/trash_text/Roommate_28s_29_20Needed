The two-story house is a 5 bedroom/3 bath located off of Poleline and Covell.  Please be 420-friendly, gay-friendly, and wanting to make 4 new friends, not just 4 roommates.  There are 3 girls (ages 22-24) and a guy (age 22) already living here. You'd have your own 10x10 (a little bigger, I think) bedroom and share a bathroom with the one guy (he's REALLY clean, though).  House has wireless internet access, extended cable, tivo, washer and dryer, large kitchen, garage (we take monthly turns keeping our cars there), and small front and back yards.   Contact: ["LizaAbeja"].

Is this really the appropriate forum for this kind of post? If we want to allow/encourage "classifieds", we might want to consider some format which would allow for containment (not to mention more effective publicity). -- Elvin

I really think this belongs on [http://sacramento.craigslist.org] -- ["ArlenAbraham" aa][[BR]]

It's on [http://sacramento.craigslist.org Craigslist] already...   I think the idea is to create a comprehensive classified listing on the wiki that caters to Davis.  It'll certainly take more than just one ad to get it going, but it's a start.  -- ["SummerSong"]
