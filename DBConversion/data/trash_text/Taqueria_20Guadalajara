The Guad offers a tremendous variety of reasonably priced food, from tacos and burritos to burgers, and every kind of meat, including fish and shrimp.  Free chips and salsa are included with every order.  Be forewarned, a sign on the door of the North Davis Guad reads: ''No Socks No Shoes No Dogs No Cats No Service.''  (That last bit is uncomfortably accurate, particluarly during peak hours.)

There's something amazing about the guad's burritos.  They're very tightly wrapped but full of so much goodness.  Places like ["Chipotle"] tend to give you large burritos but at the expense of having something closer to a ball than a burrito.  The guad delivers tightly wrapped huge burritos.

The chips are free and plentiful, as is the delicious salsa.

I (["ChrisTakemura" ct]) recommend the pastor.  It's good in burritos and tacos, or on a tostada.  The nachos look apocalyptically good, but I haven't tried those.  Their horchata's delicious, though perhaps a shade too cinnamony.
