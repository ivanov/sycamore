Unfortunately, after a number of noise violations and graduating house-mates the Filthy Whore was forced to hoist its anchor and move to a new location. The Pirate Ship had a ground breaking year, hopefully their new house will bring on another chapter in the party books of Davis.  The new pirate ship is located on 616 Anderson Rd. (not too far from their old location at 748 Mulberry Lane).  The ship now features a swimming pool and other high-class luxuries only afforded to high society playboys like the pirates (such as an outside bar).

Although it will probably end up being troublesome, the Pirate Ship was written up in a Sac news and review [http://www.newsreview.com/issues/sacto/2004-11-04/clubber.asp article].

The current Pirate Ship (at 616 Anderson) was also a show house in the late 80s (under different ownership, of course), and bands such as the Replacements, Violent Femmes, Meat Puppets, Camper Van Beethoven, Savage Republic, Jeffrey Lee Pierce, and local bands like Thin White Rope, Game Theory, the Avengers, and the Popealopes played there.
