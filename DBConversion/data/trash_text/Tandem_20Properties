Tandem Properties is one of the larger property management companies in Davis.  They offer 14 ["Apartments" apartment complexes] in Davis and ["Woodland"].  

They are a sponsor of the ["Aggie Pack"] which means you can get a shirt with their logo (YAY!) on it at most ["Aggie Pack"] events, and you can get Aggie Pack temporary tattoos at their various complexes.  

Their [http://www.tandemproperties.com/index.html really cheesy website] offers more information on all of their complexes, including rents and amenities.

If you're interested in living in any of the ["Apartments" apartments] that are leased by Tandem then you should give them a call.
