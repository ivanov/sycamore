There is a foundation comprised of two sections of cement on the south side of the ["Arboretum" arboretum] path. At some point someone made a temporary labyrinth in the wester half of the foundation. I think that this was a foundation for a farmhouse, but I'm not sure about that. There are sections of the foundation that look like chimney supports. Even though the pony express usually stopped in Sacramento and the mail was transfered to steamboats sometimes a rider would pass by here on his way to San Francisco. There is a monument to this effect on the other side of the path to the southwest from the ruins.

Surely there are some decent ["Urban Legends"] that can rise from this site.
