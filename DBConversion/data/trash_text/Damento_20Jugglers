The Damento Jugglers  ('''Da'''vis-Sacra'''mento''') meet on Tuesday nights in ["Davis"] at ["Central Park"] in the summer, and whereever they can scrounge indoor space in the winter (see [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/damento/] for email exchanges discussing the latest meeting spots) or visit the [http://www.damento.org Damento Website].  Note that this group is participatory, free, not a performing troupe, and includes students and non-students.  If you are looking for a professional juggler to perform for your event, ["JeffNewmiller"] can ask around for you but no guarantees.
