Explorit is a non-profit organization committed to involving people in science experiences that touch their lives.  They have a center which is open to the public weekends and weekday afternoons.  They have programs which reach out to schools and community sites in the greater Davis area.  Such programs include things like their annual "Perseid Meteor Shower Viewing Party", which (in 2004) took place at the remote Fairfield Elementary school.

They are building a new center which looks promising. (Pictured above)

They have an [http://www.explorit.org official web site] that includes a schedule of events to come.

''I attended their 2004 Perseid viewing, and while I only caught the tail end of the Explorit organized part, I had a really nice time.  The location was near perfect -- far, far ["West Davis"] (so far that it was actually in the ["Outskirts"] of town) -- and the sky was crystal clear.  They had telescopes and neon-glowing lights set up, but they were closing up shop as we got there (around 1AM).'' - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
