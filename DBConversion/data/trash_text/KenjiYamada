I graduated in June 2004 with a major in ["Linguistics"] and minor in Ancient Greek.  I'm half Japanese and half miscellaneous western European-American.  My three favorite bands are (in order) Smashing Pumpkins, Augie March, and Radiohead.  I'm interested in Irish Gaelic (gaeilge).  I like to whistle and to skip.  I can play guitar okay.  My favorite restaurants in Davis are ["Crepeville" Crepeville] and of course ["Guadalajara" GUAD].  My favorite coffee shop is ["Cafe Roma" campus Roma].  I have a [http://www.livejournal.com/~hajenso livejournal].  I plan to join the Peace Corps in a year or so.  ["CatherineRichardson"] is my girlfriend.

I sign everything I write on the internet that isn't real-time like this:

''2004-12-14 20:40:28'' [[nbsp]] Sorry not exactly an expert on religion, atheist here : ). But I know that there are some Christian groups on campus that do no affliate with any particular sect which is what I was referring to - ["JamesDawe"]------
''2004-12-14 20:44:43'' [[nbsp]] No worries, I know what you mean.  But those sects do espouse uniquely Protestant ideas.  I'm pretty much an atheist myself, but I grew up in the Evangelical culture and that's the culture that those groups belong to. - ["KenjiYamada"]------
''2004-12-14 20:51:21'' [[nbsp]] Hmm so General Evangelical = nondenominal Protestant, got you. One question tho, why is First Year Baptist considered this and not Baptist? They don't exclude other sects? - ["JamesDawe"]------
''2004-12-14 21:02:23'' [[nbsp]] Oh, you're right.  Haha, sorry.  Yes FBC is Baptist.  The line between nondenom Evangelical and Baptist, Methodist, etc. is often very thin or nonexistent though. - ["KenjiYamada"]
