Chris Rood, more commonly known as 'Twiggie', or 'Professor Twiggie One-Ball', is a scrawny guy majoring in ECS.  He's your average run of the mill ["engineering students" engineering student], except for his association with ["Students for an Orwellian Society"] and dressing up like a chick on one Halloween, and as a priest with a crusified, stuffed fetus the following Halloween.  He's the Minister of Peace for the Orwellians (MiniPax),  and is therefore in charge of declaring peace on other organizations. As part of this duty, he is campaign manager for ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"].

The nickname "One-Ball" was gained after a painful incident while sparring with ["RevChad"].

Also, if he refuses to change his own page, he will be forever known as ["MarieHuynh"]'s bitch. ["StarrOleary"] is the secondary master.

Plus, contrary to popular belief, Twiggie says "I'm not anorexic, I'm just fucked up."
