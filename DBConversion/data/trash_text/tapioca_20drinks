Tapioca drinks are sometimes called boba or pearl tea.  You can get them at:

 * ["Tapioca Express"]
 * ["Old Teahouse"]
 * The ["Coffee House" CoHo] (not recommended - ["PhilipNeustrom" philip])
 * ["The Posh Bagel"] has a limited selection

Making your own tapioca drinks can be very difficult.  You can buy the tapioca balls at the Korean store next to ["Silver Dragon"], but you need to soak them in water for just the right amount of time and prepare them properly.  If you can figure out how to make your own tapioca drinks then you're set for life, as they usually cost $2.50-3.00.
