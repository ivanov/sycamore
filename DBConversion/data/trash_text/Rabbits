Rabbits and other ["Davis Wildlife" wildlife] can be seen all around Davis.  The northwest corner of 80 and Mace and ["West Davis"] are full of them, darting from headlights at night.

The Black-Tailed Jackrabbit, or ''Lepus californicus'' is the most common rabbit found around here.  It is pictured below.
