= Free Information -- Free Software =

We strongly believe that information should be free
 * free to access
 * free to modify and build upon
 * free from advertisements and intrusive commercial influence

Likewise, we support Free Software
 * Wiki software is open-source and written in Python and Java.
   * Because we started with free software we were able to get off the ground quickly.
 * Our server runs Fedora Core 2
 * The site is extremely accessible and optimized for Firefox
 * In fact, 33% of our visitors use Firefox
