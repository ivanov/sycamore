Welcome to the [http://daviswiki.org DavisWiki.org] development wiki!  This is where we discuss development issues and try to make our wiki software work properly.  The version of the software running right here is typically the 'somewhat stable' version that we keep around for testing before moving it to the 'real-deal' sites.  If you want to play around see ["Wiki Sand Box"] or just go ahead and do whatever.

If you want to contribute to the code, see ["How To: Install"].  Our subversion repository is at http://daviswiki.org/repos. If you fix something or make a new feature, feel free to email [[MailTo(philipn AT gmail DOT com)]] a patch (for now.  Eventually we'll have a better way to do stuff).

We've got a bunch of ["known issues"] and ["stuff we should do"].  We've also got some ["Sites running our stuff"].

If you have not worked on the DavisWiki/RocWiki codebase, you might want to check out the ["Developer Overview"].

[http://projectsycamore.org Sycamore] is the code name for the next major software release.
