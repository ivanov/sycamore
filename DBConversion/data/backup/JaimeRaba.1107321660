Former law student sometimes called "Jay."

Lurks around Davis as a shadow of his former self.  While a law student, convinced himself that he didn't really have much of a college experience at ["UC Riverside"] and ["Notre Dame"] (except for the football games.. those were good), so he spent his time in Davis mostly partying with undergrads and pretending to attend law school.

Time was mostly spent throwing parties at the BatCave (next to Rite Aid, on Russell at Oeste), but had to move thanks to well.. basically being forced to move.  While at the BatCave, hosted several bands, received many noise compaints, although on one occasion actually tricked the City of ["Davis"] into issuing a noise permit when Six More Months played(which actually kept the cops from breaking up the party).  

Having graduated from law school, mostly hangs out in ["Bars" bars] while he keeps getting older, but they stay the saaaaaaaame age, and is beginning to think about the practice of law. Now residing at ["The Treehouse"], still mutters about having a huge BBQ/party in his huge communal back yard (which was designed by ["Hippies"]).
