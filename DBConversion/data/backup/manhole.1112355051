A manhole (also known as a maintenance hole) is an entry way from the street into the great underground depths.  While almost always unnoticed by the casual pedestrian or driver, these manholes lead to an array of treasures such as sewers, storm drains, telephone switches, and the ever-so-elusive gas pipes.

Until now, citizens of Davis had to stumble helplessly through the streets in search of manholes.  The City and various corporations attempt to limit information on this important topic.  In the interest of the public good, we press on with a critical analysis of Davis' vast and often chaotic manhole and manhole cover system.

After reading this page you should feel comfortable:
 1. Spotting manholes as you walk by them.
 2. Identifying different kinds of manholes by their cover design.
 3. Cataloging newly identified manhole covers for future scientific and public inquiry.
 4. Finding manholes with the use of GIS data, GPS receivers, and the Wiki Map functionality.
 5. Opening manhole covers and exploring sewers.

Manholes can usually be spotted by means of finding their ''manhole cover'' -- a (usually round) region cut out of the normal sidewalk or street, typically with a few holes through it.  The cover usually reads ''Sewer'', ''Water'', or ''Telephone''.  However, the only real way to know what's inside of the manhole is to open it yourself (''covered below!'')

= What to do if you find a manhole =
In the rare event you encounter a manhole, what is the proper way to report it?  Here is the recommended approach, used by __Citizens for Open Manholes__:

== Step 1 ==
[[Thumbnail(step1.jpg, "Obtain a crayon.")]]  [[Thumbnail(step2.jpg, "Obtain a piece of paper (100% post-consumer recycled paper is best).")]]

== Step 2 ==

== Step 3 ==
[[Thumbnail(step4.jpg, "Place the piece of paper (ref. step 1) on top of the manhole cover's primary design.")]]

== Step 4 ==

While taking an interest in the manhole cover itself may often reveal important details essential to urban survival, there is often the need to adjust things like telephone service, sewer systems, and water pipes in a more prompt and effective manner (after all, when was the last time city services got this right on their own?)  Unfortunately, like so many other things, matters are best taken into your own, skilled hands.

The first thing you'll need to do when opening a manhole is identify the holes in the cover.  These are typically circular and toward the edges, but they can be found in different shapes and locations.  The manhole at ["Third and B"] (pictured left) features 4 holes, each on the far edge of the disc.   In order to open the manhole it was required to use a pair of crowbars.  In this case, two people worked together to open the manhole, but in the case you're going at it alone you'll need to either get both crowbars in independently then push on both at once (somewhat difficult to do but requires no prep work) or weld two crowbars together at the base and press a single bar down (easy to do but requires metalshop prep work).

An entire world opens up before your eyes once the manhole's cover has been lifted -- but beware!  Many sewers are infested with rats (which carry the plague) and possibly alligators (''please update if you can confirm alligators in Davis' sewers'').  There may or may not be a ladder to ease entry into the sewer system.  You should be prepared with a head-mounted light, as well.  After you're inside, make sure you don't let the manhole cover slip back over the hole!  It can be very, very difficult to remove a manhole cover from the inside (''trust me on this one.'')

Because manholes are so rare, we attempt to compile a map of local manholes.  Through the amazing collaborative powers of wiki, we can maintain a record of all manholds, information about each one, some designs (see "What to do if I find a manhole"), photographs, and personal stories/accounts of various manholes.
