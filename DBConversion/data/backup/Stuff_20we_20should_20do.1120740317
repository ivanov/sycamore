 * Fix the file attachments in IE so that they NEVER EVER EVER show up as {{{C__My_Documents_crap.jpeg}}}

== refactor the parser ==
The parser is huge and ugly right now.  If you want to do some lightweight parsing of, say, a single string then you're in a world of pain.  Also, sometimes you want to use a subset of the parser.  text_html.py parser is derived from a base parser, but text_html is itself too complicated a parser.  There ought to be a layer in-between so we can plug and play with subsets of our markup for use in macros, actions, etc.

 * Assigned to: ??? you?

== move to a DBMS ==
Begin the move to a db backend (mySQL using InnoDB).  We're already hacking our way around this, and it's just going to get messier the more we go along.  Total integration will come soon.

== super easy stuff ==
--XFix thumbnail macro so that it converts PNG/GIFs to the right thing before scaling them, scales them, then converts them back to indexedX--
  We can consider this one done, although the file size for the resized images is still kind of large.  PIL is bad at compressing images.

Anything from [http://daviswiki.org/Bug_reports].

== All-in-one imaging ==
Throw together {{{attachment:}}}, {{{borderless:}}} and {{{[[Thumbnail]]}}} into a simple, easy to use, {{{[[Image]]}}}.

== Case insensitive macros ==
Macros, like anything else, shouldn't depend upon casing.  That's just nerdy.

== A better, stronger map ==
See ["Wiki Map 2"]

== Events board edits ==
Events board should allow you to edit the individual events.  Maybe move events board into DB?

== Image system ==
'Images' button should lead to a nice little area with image thumbnails displayed for all the images.  The thumbnailed version of each image should sort of it under the normal image, marked a bit differently.

Images should be integrated with the DB to allow for versioning as well as author information.  This information would be available in the Images area.
