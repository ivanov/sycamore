Livejournal.com (LJ, pronounced eljay, spelled eljay by those who are ludicrous) is the amazing journaling site that many UC Davis students waste their time on.  It has been around since 1999.  For a while, the site had growth-slowing measures in place: access was granted if you knew someone with an invite code. But lo! the admins saw fit to open the site up to everyone again. Lj-ers can update via an html page or through one of the many convenient [http://www.livejournal.com/download/ eljay clients].

The [http://www.livejournal.com/~ucdavis UC Davis LJ community] has gained notoriety amongst UC LJ communities and has appeared on [http://www.ljdrama.org ljdrama.org]  The climate of the community changes drastically each minute and can have as many as 30 posts in a day.  Regulars consider it a very informational and social group.

We have LJ to thank for the many friendships we have today ;)  (To say nothing of some long-standing emnities.)

Perhaps the main problem with the UC Davis LJ community isn't the lack of moderation (or rather, some form of content control) but the fact it is being used for all the wrong reasons.  People post things knowing that they will pop up to the top of everyone's "friends" pages, regardless of how tired or unappealing the topic is to those subscribed.  I guess that it would work a lot better in some bulletin board format, wherein stupid inane shit gets rightfully passed to the bottom of the board.

Some curmudgeons point to the UCD LJ community as a prime example of [http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/S/Sturgeons-Law.html Sturgeon's Law].
