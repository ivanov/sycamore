## Want to suggest a featured page?  Bored of the current one?  Well, you ought to suggest a new one (with a little writeup) on the page "Next Featured Page"!  You could, of course, just edit this page directly, but if you suggest it first then you can get feedback.

The annual struggle to keep a roof over your head can be pretty taxing, especially for students.  The '''["Housing Guide"]''' provides details on finding a good place to live.  If you don't know where you're living next year, or what to ask landlords, or even what exactly you're supposed to do to find a place, make sure to check this page out (especially if you're a ["Freshman"] and have never found housing)!
