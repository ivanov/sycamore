A manhole (also known as a maintence hole) is an entryway from the street into the great underground depths.  While almost always unnoticed by the casual pedestrian or driver, these manholes lead to an array of treasures such as sewers, storm drains, telephone switches, and the ever-so-elusive gas pipes.

Until now, citizens of Davis had to stumble helplessly through the streets in search of manholes.  The City and various corporations attempt to limit information on this important topic.  In the interest of the public good, we press on with a critical analysis of Davis' vast and often chaotic manhole and manhole cover system.

After reading this page you should feel comfortable:
 1. Spotting manholes as you walk by them.
 2. Identifying different kinds of manholes by their cover design.
 3. Cataloging newly identified manhole covers for future scientific and public inquery.
 4. Finding manholes with the use of GIS data, GPS receivers, and the Wiki Map functionality.
 5. Opening manhole covers and exploring sewers.

Manholes can usually be spotted by means of finding their ''manhole cover'' -- a (usually round) region cut out of the normal sidewalk or street, typically with a few holes through it.  The cover usually reads ''Sewer'', ''Water'', or ''Telephone''.  However, the only real way to know what's inside of the manhole is to open it yourself (''covered below!'')

In the rare event you encounter a manhole, what is the proper way to report it?  Here is the recommended approach, used by __Citizens for Open Manholes__:

== Step 1 ==
[[Thumbnail(step1.jpg, "Obtain a crayon.")]]  [[Thumbnail(step2.jpg, "Obtain a piece of paper (100% post-consumer recycled paper is best).")]]

== Step 2 ==
[[Thumbnail(step3.jpg, "Approach and center the manhole cover in your field of vision.")]]

== Step 3 ==
[[Thumbnail(step4.jpg, "Place the piece of paper (ref. step 1) on top of the manhole cover's primary design.")]]

== Step 4 ==
[[Thumbnail(step5.jpg, "Slowly, but gently, drag the crayon over the surface of the paper.")]]

== Step 5 ==
[[Thumbnail(step6.jpg, "Submit your precise trace to an independent manhole interest society.")]]

While taking an interest in the manhole cover itself may often reveal important details essential to urban survivial, there is often the need to adjust things like telephone service, sewer systems, and water pipes in a more prompt and effective manner (after all, when was the last time city services got this right on their own?)
