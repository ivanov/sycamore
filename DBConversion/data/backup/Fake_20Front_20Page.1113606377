= Getting Started =
First, check out the ["Davis Wiki Guide"].  This is a good place to start!

A Wiki is a linked set of pages that ''anybody can edit and contribute to'' '''without knowing anything about websites'''.  [wiki:WikiPedia: Wikipedia] is the prime example of a successful wiki project.  Also, check out [wiki:Wiki:WhyWikiWorks Why Wiki Works] for some information on the philosophy of wiki.

After reading that stuff, and playing around in the ["Wiki Sand Box"], check out our ["FAQ"].  We also have a ["Title Index"] with all the pages in the wiki.

Feel free to make new pages -- just remember to link them.  Also, if you don't know where to start or don't have any ideas, check out ["To Do"]
