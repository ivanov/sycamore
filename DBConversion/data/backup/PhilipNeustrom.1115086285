''2005-03-27 21:40:26'' [[nbsp]] any thoughts on having a "stub" macro that would insert stub text? you could then search for stubs. --["ArlenAbraham"]

''2005-03-30 17:21:09'' [[nbsp]] What is the difference between a page ABOUT a business and a page BY a business and obviously geared towards advertising?  How do we (or should we) deal with the later type of page?  I had this question in response to some recent postings, but I just want to see what people have to say about it.  I imagine this will be a more frequent concern as the wiki becomes more well known.  (please forgive if this has been discussed before) --["CarlMcCabe"]
   * ''Is this with reference to ["Chabad"]? (no -["CarlMcCabe" cm]) From my POV (as the guy who's maintaining the ["Chabad"] page) Chabad would have a low-traffic, single-page presence just about anywhere it set up. As such it makes almost no sense to create a Chabad site anywhere else. I understand the rule that pages aren't going to be mouthpieces for a single organization, but it's kind of unlikely that Chabad will do anything controversial, so this is almost entirely a moot point. If it does get controversial, and we decide we want a mouthpiece, then I'll figure out about moving the site somewhere where that's not collaboratively edited. -- ["KenBloom"]''
   * ''There is no difference.  A business owner has equal right to edit their entry as you do.  That goes both ways - you can add your views, and they can add theirs.  A couple businesses have been listing specials and deals (one of the cell phone stores updates their deals fairly often).  That's a good thing - it's more information on the Wiki, and constant updating keeps the information current and useful.  If they started deleting bad reviews, they would be behaving as a poor editor (it doesn't require a business owner to do this - Saul deleted a few when he first arrived)... and poor editing often is best combated through education rather than a kneejerk reaction.''  -- ["JabberWokky"]
   * ''You make a good point.  I hadn't thought of it like that.'' --["CarlMcCabe" cm]

''2005-03-30 17:32:03'' [[nbsp]] I'm not entirely sure what to do myself.   I myself have used the wiki to advertise different things on campus.  No one owns a page in the wiki, so it can be edited to represent multiple viewpoints.  And most of us ["Wikivangelists"] will be able to keep this place from turning into ["Davis411"], so I wouldn't worry.  Just edit what you think is ''excessively'' one-sided, and hopefully people who have had dealings with the business will come by and add their points of view. [[BR]][[BR]]  Of course, another option is to let businesses have home pages, much like the CamelCase pages that pretty much belong to individual users.  That resolved a lot of the issues during the ["Winter 2005 ASUCD Election"]. --["BrentLaabs"]

[[BR]] They're probably just not aware of the daviswiki, but it amazes me how tolerant businesses have been of negative comments. I've only been on the Wiki since January, but I've never seen an instance of a business owner trying to remove something bad. hmmm... maybe I should test the waters by listing where I found a band-aid in a tuna-fish sandwich? Anyway, due to their controversial and transient nature, dual-page-representation made perfect sense for the elections. However, for more stable businesses, I fear that dual-representation would clutter and confuse things greatly. Naive searches might lead people only to the biased business owner's page rather than the objective community based one. --["CraigBrozinsky"]

''2005-03-30 17:43:08'' [[nbsp]] Businesses can advertise all they want on the page for their business, but content ''about'' the business is more important and should be placed higher on the page than the advertisements. --["MikeIvanov"]
  * Also, like anything, it's important to know who is saying what.  Italics, bullets, and sections ({{{= like this =}}}) can help.

''2005-04-01 08:38:02'' [[nbsp]] Hmmm.... I hate the ads. I hate MSN probably about as much as I hate ads. I realize the need for funding and that some of us [yes, I mean myself] have been extremely lame in that department. But of all the things I've chosen to live with, inviting corporate into the community is not something I'm sure I can handle. I'm actually kinda surprised at how much this disturbs me. Maybe it would be helpful to know what benefits msn, its ads, and data collection provide... shouldn't we at least get some sort of privacy notification now that we've been sold to corporate? --["AlphaDog"]

''2005-04-01 12:40:23'' [[nbsp]] Personally, I have the [https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&version=1.0&category=Humor&numpg=10&id=217 Adbar] on my version of Firefox.  I just don't feel comfortable browsing places like daviswiki without the familiar [wiki:WikiPedia:Fnord fnords]. --["BrentLaabs"]

''2005-04-01 13:03:03'' [[nbsp]] I don't like the new intro at all. It took too long to load on high speed and it's excessive. I'd rather have it the way it was. --["SaulSugarman"]

''2005-04-01 13:37:38'' [[nbsp]] WTF. Better with the butterfly? It makes it seem like the wiki is being coded by people from microsoft? Can someone please explain a little bit better? --["MattJojola"]

''2005-04-01 14:09:11'' [[nbsp]] Chill out. Please everyone check your calendar, and wait a couple days before complaining about all of the new features. --["KenBloom"]
 ''* When I saw your first response, I just figured you were being, uh, smart. Now I realize that I'm not being so smart... what's this calendar that it sounds like I should know something about?? Maybe we could have some sort of discussion about financing the wiki. I really enjoy it to the point that I spend *way* too much time here, and definitely appreciate all the time and money that you guys have poured in to create this community. I'm curious to know if this might be something that would be eligible for community funding from the ["City of Davis"] -- that might at least offset the direct costs of hosting the wiki. BTW: Shouldn't that msn ["butterflies & moths" flutterby] be linked to one of our internal pages?? --["AlphaDog"]''

  * Now that it's 12:16, I figure that I'd reassure you that I had planned that Wiki Author of the Month award a few weeks ago, settled on you last week, and it had nothing to do with April Fool's Day.  Could be worse timing, though - I know somebody who had his attorney contact his wife (who moved away a year ago) about a divorce today.  Via email.  He's wondering if she'll take it seriously. :/  -- ["JabberWokky"]
    * ''2005-04-02 21:56:45'' [[nbsp]] Couldn't those things (the award, and the divorce) just wait another day? --["KenBloom"]
      * Eh, the award was all lined up, and I wanted to give it to him.  As for the divorce, I don't think most lawyers or the legal system in general recognize the holiday ("I sentence you to be executed... April Fools!!").  It just happened to be when the lawyer got around to his case. -- ["JabberWokky"]

''2005-04-06 14:52:29'' [[nbsp]] what if some pictures on pages are shitty, whats the policy on changing them to something better? i dont want to get anyone's panties in a twist if i replace pictures --["MattJojola"]
  * the wiki is all about panty twisting --["ArlenAbraham"]
  * If I took the shitty pictures, feel free to replace them!  Trying to make a page better is almost always a good thing
  * feel free to replace my shitty pictures too.  i think a lot of photos were put up just to fill a void.  there's a lot that ''should'' be replaced.  and i wear boxers, but you're not allowed to twist them. --["CarlMcCabe" cm]

''2005-04-22 15:59:47'' [[nbsp]] Does anyone have a need for the 'thicker' horizontal rules like {{{-----------}}}.  I think they nearly always look ugly.  Would anyone object if I switched them all to be a very fine thin line, like I have [http://dev.daviswiki.org/index.cgi/PhilipNeustrom here]? --["PhilipNeustrom"]
