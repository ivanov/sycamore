 * Fix the file attachments in IE so that they NEVER EVER EVER show up as {{{C__My_Documents_crap.jpeg}}}

== refactor the parser ==
The parser is huge and ugly right now.  If you want to do some lightweight parsing of, say, a single string then you're in a world of pain.  Also, sometimes you want to use a subset of the parser.  text_html.py parser is derived from a base parser, but text_html is itself too complicated a parser.  There ought to be a layer in-between so we can plug and play with subsets of our markup for use in macros, actions, etc.

== move to a DBMS ==
Begin the move to a db backend (mySQL using InnoDB).  We're already hacking our way around this, and it's just going to get messier the more we go along.  Total integration will come soon.

== super easy stuff ==
--XFix thumbnail macro so that it converts PNG/GIFs to the right thing before scaling them, scales them, then converts them back to indexedX--
  We can consider this one done, although the file size for the resized images is still kind of large.  PIL is bad at compressing images.
  
  I know I've done almost no work lately, but I had a suggestion for a while and I've wanted to put it down so I don't forget again.  I [[heart]] the Wanted Pages interface, but the top wanted pages are usually the result of people without user pages leaving tons of comments.  Would it make it more useful if the usernames were purged from the list before the sizes are normalized?
    I agree that this would be better, but what's a ''user'', anyway?  Maybe just put everyone on {{{People}}}?
      Everyone in {{PUser Statistics}}} because people in {{{People}}} already have pages typically.
        Sounds good!

== All-in-one imaging ==
Throw together {{{attachment:}}}, {{{borderless:}}} and {{{[[Thumbnail]]}}} into a simple, easy to use, {{{[[Image]]}}}.

See ["New image macro"].

== Case insensitive macros ==
Macros, like anything else, shouldn't depend upon casing.  That's just nerdy.

== A better, stronger map ==
See ["Wiki Map 2"]

== Events board edits ==
Events board should allow you to edit the individual events.  Maybe move events board into DB?

== Image system ==
'Images' button should lead to a nice little area with image thumbnails displayed for all the images.  The thumbnailed version of each image should sort of it under the normal image, marked a bit differently.

Images should be integrated with the DB to allow for versioning as well as author information.  This information would be available in the Images area.

== super-easy install process ==
This goes without saying.  We just need some scripts that set up the MySQL tables for an empty wiki and sets up the auxilary applications.  Perhaps we should get rid of as many of the auxilary search applications as possible by integrating the Xapian stuff within Python (I had little success with this before, but if anyone wants to try and take a stab please do!)

== every page has an rss feed ==
the feed is its own little recent changes.  this is easy and possible w/db.
