This is a rough to do list for the next couple of days for me.  I keep it here so i don't accidentially lose it.

lost password thing?  keep it as a dictionary?  sure..maybe..yeah.
---
admin browser thing for images and other stuff
---
footer for the image view thinger and the main normal image area.
----
make the normal image area thing window look okay inside the window.
----
make 'Images' do exactly what it does now...?  -- maybe it should do something different now, no popups?  so they dont lose their work?  (that's the main concern, right?--- so they can edit and add images at the same time without having to use a tabbed browser.
 * maybe we can use xmlhttpdrequest crap?
 * What do we do when they click on the "attach an image to the page?" link?
----

Images can have thumbnail comments (table) as well as upload comments (stored in image table and done while uploading).
----
after all image stuff:  test to see if it still works with images with weird characters in their names.  '&' and so forth.
