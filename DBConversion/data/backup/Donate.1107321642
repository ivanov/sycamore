= Vision =
The Davis Wiki project is a community, non-profit effort to compile the undefined elements of everything Davis.  Everyone can contribute and edit content -- it is no one person or group's site.  With this in mind, we intend to keep Davis Wiki completely free and, equally importantly, free from banner ads and other advertising.  Forever.  The only page that will ever mention our generous sponsors by name is this page.

= Costs =
Regardless of intentions, running a web site is not a free enterprise.  Aside from the time spent coding features and regular site maintenance, which we gladly donate for free, we do need to pay for ["Wiki hosting" hosting] and yearly domain-name renewal/registration.  These costs are not tremendous but they are existent. So we ask -- if you enjoy the site and want to help keep it running for as long as possible -- that you make a contribution.

Please, donate only if it is convenient for you.  Many of us are students, and we have all experienced being completely broke.  We don't need a lot, but a couple bucks from a couple people would really help.  The money will be put into a [http://paypal.com PayPal] account used exclusively for site matters (non-profit).

= Progress =
Our current goal is to raise $1000 in donations, which would cover nearly all costs for an entire year.  These include dedicated server hosting, which will allow us to improve our features and make the site fast and reliable, as well as promotional items such as Davis Wiki stickers.

The total raised so far, as of January 28, 2005 is: {{{$285.00}}}
