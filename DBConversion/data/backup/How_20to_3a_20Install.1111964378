= Getting the software =
Obviously, the first step is to download the software.  Right now the only way to do is is via our [http://subversion.tigris.org/ subversion] server.  Our repository is located at http://daviswiki.org/repos.  If you don't know anything about subversion but have it installed, typing {{{svn checkout http://daviswiki.org/repos/trunk working_copy}}} will grab the code and put it in the directory {{{working_copy}}}.

= Setting it up =
Now the subversion directory that you just checked out has three directories:  installhtml, LocalWiki, and util_apps.
  * '''installhtml''' is the set of default html documents and images needed for the wiki install.  This directory contains the actual wiki data (pages, etc), as well as an entirely empty search database (''note: this needs help.  need to fill the search db with default stuff, as well as add more default pages for the install!'')
  * '''LocalWiki''' is the set of python libraries that are required by the wiki.  These are imported whenever the wiki is run.  This directory will be the one you'll get updates from and hack (most often).  Once everything else is setup this will likely be all you hack or update from the repository.
  * '''util_apps''' is a collection of helper utilities as well as databases we use for things such as searching.

== First step ==
Throw {{{installhtml}}} into a place visable by apache.  Remember where you put it.  Put {{{LocalWiki}}} in a place where python can easily import it.  There is typically a python site package area somewhere on your system, but it's not even required to put it there.  Honestly, it might be best to just keep all these three directories right next to each other, something like this:
 * /var/ww/
  * /var/www/html (''example of where your apache DocumentRoot might be''')
    * installhtml/
  * util_apps/
  * LocalWiki/

== Stuff you've got to change ==
 * First step is fixing the monster of them all, {{{localwiki_config.py}}}, which is located in {{{installhtml/dwiki/}}}.  Explaining what each variable means is too hard, so I will just give you an example of configuration file and you'll probably figure it out:

=== Example 1 ===
Say my web root is /var/www/html and that's where I put all the above documents (as explained).  Then my localwiki_config.py will look like this (i have included only what needs to be changed.  '''this file is not complete'''--you need to include the other variables, but just don't change them):

'''remember:  no slashes at the end of file names'''
{{{

data_dir = '/var/www/html/installhtml/dwiki/data'

web_root = '/var/www/html/installhtml/'

web_dir = ''

app_dir = '/var/www/util_apps'

url_prefix = '/wiki'

relative_dir = 'index.cgi'

domain = 'localhost'

acl_rights_default = "AdminGroup:admin,read,write,delete,revert PhilipNeustrom:read,write,delete,revert,admin MikeIvanov:read,write,delete,revert,admin BannedGroup:read Trusted:read,write,revert,delete Known:read,write,delete,revert All:read"

attachments = {
    'dir': '/var/www/html/installhtml/dwiki/data/pages',
    'url': '/dwiki/data/pages',
}

mail_from = "dont_respond@localhost"

}}}

==== Other files you need to change ====
With the above alterations in mind, the first thing you need to fix is the path in {{{index.cgi}}}, which is located inside of {{{installhtml}}}.  In the above case, I change it to:
{{{
import sys
sys.path.extend(['/var/www','/var/www/html/installhtml/dwiki'])
}}}

The first part (/var/www) is where the LocalWiki libraries are located.  The second part is where the wiki data is located.

Next you need to change some of the scripts in {{{util_apps}}}.  You need to alter the lines in {{{add_to_index}}} and {{{remove_from_index}}} exactly as I did above for {{{index.cgi}}}.


...I think that's it?
