This is a rough to do list for the next couple of days for me.  I keep it here so i don't accidentially lose it.

lost password thing?  keep it as a dictionary?  sure..maybe..yeah.
---
no filesize:  instead just the name

filesize goes on info page

 then make view & info work
then make delete work.
admin browser thing.--works?

---
footer for the image view thinger and the main normal image area.
----
make the normal image area thing window look okay inside the window.
----
make 'Images' do exactly what it does now...?  -- maybe it should do something different now, no popups?  so they dont lose their work?  (that's the main concern, right?--- so they can edit and add images at the same time without having to use a tabbed browser.
 * maybe we can use xmlhttpdrequest crap?
 * What do we do when they click on the "attach an image to the page?" link?
----

Images can have thumbnail comments (table) as well as upload comments (stored in image table and done while uploading).
----
after all image stuff:  test to see if it still works with images with weird characters in their names.  '&' and so forth.

=== recent changes fixes ==
rework RC to not use the current time to sort by and instead use the smallest time in allPages/other crap and the current time to compare to that in display.  this will allow it to be cached by mysql's query cache.

fix it so it works with 'clear observed changes' as well as the max days parameter.

== Info tab ==
display ('previous 100 edits') / toggles for all edits
