''["PhilipNeustrom" I] was leaked the location and time of the meeting, and decided to get some friends together to go and document, as best we could, the people and activities involved.  The following photographs and text is taken from a purely outsiders standpoint, as we never entered the meeting.''

The organization reserved ["MU II"], ["Smith Room"], ["Garrison Room"], and the ["Fielder Room"].  The main meeting took place in ["MU II"], and the other rooms were used for catering or smaller meetings.

While ["MU II"] is hardly secluded, this was, after all, a Saturday night -- practically no one was on ["Campus"] and the likelihood of someone stumbling by the meeting while it was in progress was minimal.  Of particular note is how well dressed everyone was.  The student members were wearing suits or nice dress clothes.  The ["ASUCD"] officials were dressed much better than they usually are for ["Senate"] meetings.

The bulk of the meeting seemed to consist of gathering around tables and talking.  ["Kalen Gallegher"] (["ASUCD President"], ["Student Focus"]) was one of the first students to show up.  There was a small podeum set up, along with a laptop connected to a projecter.
