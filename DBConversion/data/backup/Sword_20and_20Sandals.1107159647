''["PhilipNeustrom" I] was leaked the location and time of the meeting, and decided to get some friends together to go and document, as best we could, the people and activities involved.  The following photographs and text is taken from a purely outsiders standpoint, as we never entered the meeting.''

The organization reserved ["MU II"], ["Smith Room"], ["Garrison Room"], and the ["Fielder Room"].  The main meeting took place in ["MU II"], and the other rooms were used for catering or smaller meetings.

While ["MU II"] is hardly secluded, this was, after all, a Saturday night -- practically no one was on ["Campus"] and the likelihood of someone stumbling by the meeting while it was in progress was minimal.  Of particular note is how well dressed everyone was.  The student members were wearing suits or nice dress clothes.  The ["ASUCD"] officials were dressed much better than they usually are for ["Senate"] meetings.

The bulk of the meeting seemed to consist of gathering around tables and talking.  ["Kalen Gallegher"] (["ASUCD President"], ["Student Focus"]) was one of the first students to show up.  There was a small podeum set up, along with a laptop connected to a projecter.

== The Garrison Room ==
[[Thumbnail(IMG_1142.jpg,"A document is read aloud to three unknown individuals.")]]

Perhaps the most mysterious of events unfolded in the ["Garrison Room"], adjacent to ["MU II"].  ["Kalen Gallegher"] and a number of other unidentified individuals headed into the room after the meeting in the main room had began.  First the lights appeared to be on, then they turned off and strange music was heard from within the room (''note:  not sure if the music was coming from the main room or this room in particular'').  Afterward the photo to the left was taken.

After leaving the ["Garrison Room"], a number of items were left behind.  Three brown bags, three packets of soil, and a number of candies and coins were left there.  The bags looked to be originally taped together, and it is likely the items came from the bags. 

It is possible that the reading that took place, the music, and the brown bags filled with strange items was some sort of ritual.  After all, there were three people sitting in front of the bags in the first ["Garrison Room"] photograph.

Suddenly, after the meeting in the main room had been underway for a while, the lights went off.  It was then noticed that ''candles were lit''!
