Livejournal.com (LJ) is the amazing journaling site that many UC Davis students waste their time on.  It used to be an exclusive site: access was granted if you knew someone with an invite code. But the admins saw it fruituitous to open the site up to EVERYONE. Lj-ers can update via an html page or through one of the many convenient LJ clients (programs that allow you to update without actually visiting the site).

The [http://www.livejournal.com/~ucdavis UC Davis LJ community] has gained notoriety amongst UC LJ communities and has appeared on ljdrama.com  The climate of the community changes drastically each minute and can have as many as 30 posts in a day. A very informational and social group; UCD LJ breaks the stereotypes about internet dating/meeting (sometimes enforces them on rare occassion).

We have LJ to thank for the many friendships we have today ;)
