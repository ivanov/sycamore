So, this is my little home on the Wiki.

I'm a ["Mathematics"] major here at Davis.

I have a ["LiveJournal"] which is at [http://livejournal.com/~codetoad].  I don't seem to update it as much as I should, though.

My email address is [[MailTo(philipn AT gmail DOT com)]]. My AOL Instant Messenger name is {{{CodeToad01}}}, and I'm on that fairly often if you want to chat.  For wiki-centric stuff, please email [[MailTo(daviswiki AT gmail DOT com)]] (for now).

= Some Favorite Pages =
 * ["Night Time"] - Find out what's open late at night!  Literally the most important resource in Davis :P
 * ["Davis Map"] - Too awesome to leave off this list.
 * ["Cleanest Bathrooms"] - An idea whose time has come.
 * ["Payphone Project"] - 2600 31337 factor.
 * ["Wikivangelists"] - I was lost and now I have found the path.

= What do I do on the Wiki? =
I make a lot of edits.  What do I usually edit?  These are my most common edits:
 * I link phrases and terms to pages in order to add more stucture.
 * I remove comments and try to integrate them into the page's body if possible.
 * I take differing viewpoints or arguments and attempt to find a common ground.  Nearly any argument or difference of opinion can be solved by merely expanding the writeup to be larger, more general, and less specific.  ["Students for an Orwellian Society"] is a great example (check out the revision history).

I also have a ["/To Do" To Do] page that you likely do not care about.

== Note to self ==
''Davis from the Inside Out by William D. Diemer. National housing register, 216 F Street, PMB 17.  This is an interesting compilation of a ton of Davis related information that can be purchased for $15 at ["Newsbeat"].  I might buy it to help out with facts/info.''

''2005-04-17 15:02:28'' [[nbsp]] You can't find any information about Black Family Day because you need to search for Black Family Week. There's a lesson in here, somewhere. --["TravisGrathwell"]
  * It seems that "Black Family Day" is an event during ["Black Family Week"], and that they moved "back to their old format" in 2000:
    "This is the first Black Family Day to come back in its old format," said Stephen Baissa, event coordinator. The old format will cater to families interested in visiting UCD to witness dance and music throughout the day.
  Wish I knew more..

''2005-04-17 18:19:22'' [[nbsp]] Noticed your mini-rant.  ["RobertBaron"] had the same problem, and he managed to get a free iPod Photo and a new iBook from Apple.  Maybe you should talk to him. --["BrentLaabs"]

''2005-04-18 16:26:15'' [[nbsp]] Good luck with the new laptop.  Most people don't have problems with Apple hardware, so I hope your old one was a lemon and the new one serves you well. --["JabberWokky"]

''2005-04-18 21:55:24'' [[nbsp]] Congrats on the new Mac. Hey, just a reminder. Free Cone Day is tomorrow if you want to do the Ben & jerry's thing to the logo. --["RobRoy"]

''2005-04-21 18:45:31'' [[nbsp]] I know Phillip as one of the driving forces behind Wiki. This comment serves no purpose. --["GeoffJohnson"]

''3171-02-44 11:28:23'' [[nbsp]] You know, if you hate comment boxes so much, why don't you just disable them.  Personally, I like them. --["BrentLaabs"]
------
''2005-04-27 23:37:55'' [[nbsp]] Oh yeah, well if you like comment boxes so much, why don't you marry them? --["MikeIvanov"]
------
''2005-04-27 23:43:29'' [[nbsp]] your mom's married to a comment box! --["ArlenAbraham"]
------
''2005-04-27 23:52:01'' [[nbsp]] I wouldn't marry comment boxes, because they don't have enough curves.  But there is a lot of communication in the relationship. --["BrentLaabs"]

''2005-05-01 08:13:11'' [[nbsp]] Nice job with the floor plans on the map...makes me want to be a Dungeon Master again.... --["JimSchwab"]
