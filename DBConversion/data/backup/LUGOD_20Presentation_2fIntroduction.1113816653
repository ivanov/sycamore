= Original concept =
 * Why did we need something?
   * Davis-oriented sites as of Summer 2004:
     * davis411.com
     * daviscoeds.com
     * ucdavis LiveJournal community
     * California Aggie, Davis Enterprise, City of Davis, etc
   * Lacking resources for the community
     * Uncreative, unoriginal, corporate-feel:  Davis411.com
     * Limited access.  Cannot create or contribute to existing resources easily.
   * Wanted:  Information, Creativity, and Culture.
 * Central idea:
     1. Freely accessible
     2. Freely editable
     3. User-friendly
     4. Useful & entertaining information about the city and the university could be collected.
 * Wiki concept
