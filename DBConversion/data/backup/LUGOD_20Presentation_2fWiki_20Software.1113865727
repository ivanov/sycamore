= Finding wiki software =
 * somewhat new concept
 * few examples of successful projects
 * software-wise:
    * MoinMoin -- used by many in open source community
      * stuck to wiki traditions (CamelCase)
        * CamelCase makes sense when you're talkingAboutObjects
      * seemed easy to hack
    * MediaWiki -- huge, used by wikipedia
      * broke conventions (no CamelCase)
 * project-wise:
    * wikipedia
    * software documentation/open source community used wiki

= Altering the software =
 * We wanted some core features
   * Map
   * Events Board
   * But still wanted to keep it simple -- no email/bulletin board systems
 * Usability
 * Wanted it to __look nice!__

== Scalability & Usability ==
 * Didn't want CamelCase -- moin had broken link system
 * Search
  * Before:  {{{grep}}}
  * Now:  "Xapian" probabilistic engine
 * Concrete features: RSS, Bookmarks, Comments, Thumbnails...and more.
 * We've changed practically everything: editing and using simple.
