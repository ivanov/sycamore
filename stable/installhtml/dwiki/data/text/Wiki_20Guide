== Introduction ==
A ''wiki'' is a linked set of pages which anyone can edit and expand.  This freedom allows for unique expression and helps foster interesting and new ideas in an organic and very dynamic way.

If you see something you think is inaccurate or incorrect, you have the power to change it.  If you see that something is incomplete, you can add more information.  You can also create completely new content and tie it into the rest of the site.  Likewise, others have the power to veto your changes.  It is a delicate balance but one which ultimately leaves the users with the content they most want.

'''Never''' be afraid to change something or try something new!

'''IMPORTANT:'''  In order to edit pages, you must first create an account.  This is a very painless process and the only hurdle to contributing content.

Making an account is as easy as clicking a button and choosing an appropriate name (like Bob''''''Smith).  If you would like to be able to retrieve a forgotten password, you should also enter a valid email address.  That's it.  After making an account you should check out the ["People"] page and make a homepage for yourself.  

== Editing ==
Editing a page is as simple as clicking on the "Edit" tab at the top of the screen.  There are, however, many possible options for markup (i.e. making the page look pretty.)  For your convenience, we have made a formatting toolbar, which works very much like a toolbar in a word processor.  By highlighting text and clicking one of the buttons, such as Bold, the text will be surrounded by the appropriate markup to make it appear '''bold'''.  More information on editing can be found over at ["Help On Editing"].  In general, just looking at how existing pages do things (by clicking on Edit and looking at the "raw" content) should let you figure out the markup -- which is very simple!  (Always make sure you "Preview" before you "Save Changes", otherwise you might end up editing a page several times)

== Linking ==
The '''most important''' concept, though, is linking.  The idea is to have all pages linked together in a logical and intuitive way.  To make a link to a page, type the exact name of the page you wish to link to, surrounded by quotes and brackets.  This means to link to the page ["Front Page"] I type {{{["Front Page"]}}}.  It's that simple.  To make a link to a page that displays differently, such as a link to ["Front Page"] that displays ''as'' ["Front Page" Hello World!] you just write {{{["Front Page" Hello World!]}}}.  Capitalization doesn't matter for links.

Also, try to be descriptive in your linking.  Don't use the "click here!" phrase: "For more info check ["Wiki Sand Box" here]" is bad! "Check out ["Wiki Sand Box"] for more info" is good! ([http://www.w3.org W3.org] has some [http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/noClickHere tips] on good link style)

To link to a page ''outside'' the wiki, you write you link like {{{[http://en.wikipedia.org this]}}} which displays as [http://en.wikipedia.org this].  Of course, you can also just write {{{[http://en.wikipedia.org]}}} or {{{http://en.wikipedia.org}}} if you don't want any alternative text.  So remember -- use quotes for things ''inside'' the wiki, no quotes for things ''outside'' (normal websites).
== New pages ==
To '''create a page''', first think about where you want this page to be linked from.  Say you want to create a page about your favorite local band.  Ideally, there should be a link to this band in ["Music Scene"] or perhaps other pages as well.  You would go edit ["Music Scene"] to add a link to your page -- ''even though your page hasn't been made yet''.  Once you save your changes and click on the new link, you'll be given the opportunity to create the page!

'''TIP:'''  If you can't think of a page to create, look over the ["Wanted Pages"].  It is a list of pages which have been linked but have not been created.  Perfect candidates for a write-up!

If this is unclear, just view the source (by clicking on "Info" and clicking on "raw" for the top item -- or if you're lazy, just by clicking "Edit") of some pages!  It will become perfectly clear after a few minutes.

To create a page without making a link to it first, simply type the name of the desired page into the search box.  Then you will be prompted with the option of creating the page.  But remember: because you made the page without ''first'' making a link to it, it might get lost in the sea of pages.  Linking is very important for this reason -- '''If you don't link your new page from existing pages, then no one will be able to find it.'''  Spend some time thinking about good places where you should make a link to your new page.  Using the search box is very useful for finding phrases and material where you might want to provide a link.

You should head over to ["Wiki Sand Box"] and edit it and play around!

== Info Tab / Revision History ==
The wiki tracks all the changes made to all the pages, and this information is available in the Info tab at the top of the screen.  Every edit of a page accounts for a new version, and clicking "Diff" once in the Info tab allows you to see differences between selected versions.  "view" shows you what that version of the page looked like, "raw" shows you the raw wiki markup, "print" gives you a printer-friendlier version, and "revert" reverts the current version of the page back to that particular version.

In the Info tab you may also '''bookmark a page''', which allows you to track the changes to the page via the ["Bookmarks"] page.  Setting wiki bookmarks allows you to easily see when pages important to you change, and allows you to keep a list of pages you like, as well.  You should probably set a wiki bookmark for your user page so you can see when others leave you comments.
== Now what? ==
After you've made an account, viewed the source of some pages, and played around with editing over in ["Wiki Sand Box"], you should go ahead and make a home page for yourself.  To make a homepage, simply make a page in the wiki with the same name as your login name.  This means if your name is PhilipNeustrom (it's not), you simply make the page with the title PhilipNeustrom and fill it with whatever you want (and easy way to do this: click on your user name in the upper right hand corner).  After making your homepage, head over to ["People"] and add your page to the list.

Then, you should check out ["Help On Editing"]
= Mapping =
Every page in the wiki can have some map information associated with it.  Obviously, this is only a good idea in some cases (when the page can be given a geographic location).  You can browse through an interactive map  by clicking on ["Map"] up in the top tabs.  This map shows all the pages that have been given a place (or places!) on the map.  You can search using a ''combination'' of clicking checkboxes and typing in search strings into the search box in the WikiMap.  Hovering over a yellow dot tells you the name of the page and clicking on it takes you to that page.

To add a page to the map (or to delete/add additional points for a page), simply go to the page, go to Edit, and then click the "Edit Map" button displayed next to the other editing action buttons.

Pages with points (or areas) mapped will display "View Map" next to the page title.  Clicking on "View Map" will show you the specific page/region on the map.

Note:  To view the WikiMap you'll need to have Java installed.  Really, if you can, you should install Java.  It'll only take a few moments to install if you don't have it, and you'll be able to use the awesome maps we've got.
= Tips =
 * Use the 'bookmarks' in ["Recent Changes"] when you want to limit the changes you see in ["Recent Changes"].  To do this, just click "set bookmark" at the top of the current day's header.  Then, when you come back to ["Recent Changes"] you will only see changes since you last clicked "update bookmark timestamp."
 * Link link link!  After you've made a page you should search the wiki looking for places to add links to your new page.  After all, if you make a page, shouldn't you make sure everyone else can see it?  Occurrences of the page name are immediately candidates for links.  Beyond this, you can ["The Dairy" get creative] and link relevant text accordingly.
 * '''Preview!'''  Always click "Preview" before you click "Save Changes" in order to make sure everything looks right, etc!  Even the best of us forget this all too often.

= Frequently Asked Questions =
 == How do I attach images to a page? ==
 When you go into the Edit tab for a page, click the "Images" button.  This will give you some instructions on uploading an image and putting it inside of the page (under "How do I do this?").  Just remember to add the "{{{attachment:filename}}}" line to the page's text where you wish for the image to appear, where filename includes the extension of the file.  This means if I upload mypicture.jpg I would put the line "{{{attachment:mypicture.jpg}}}" where I wanted that picture, or if it was mybirthday.gif it would be "{{{attachment:mybirthday.gif}}}".
 == How do I see which pictures are on a page? ==
 By going into "Images" in the Edit tab you may see the pictures attached to the page already and choose to view them and manage them ("del", if you have the privileges, deletes the picture).
 == What are the conventions for linking and naming? ==
 Check out ["Help On Linking"].
 == Is there a way to see a list of all the pages in the wiki? ==
 Check out ["Title Index"].
 == Can I see which pages link to a particular page? ==
 Yes.  Just go to the page and '''click on the page's title'''.  Displayed will then be all the pages that link to that page.  This does a search for the page title, so this is an easy way to see where you need to turn normal text into a link to the page -- e.g. turning Mishka's into {{{["Mishka's"]}}}.  Link everything!
 == Where can I find out geeky things about this site? ==
 ["System Info"]
 == My image looks horrible with a border, is there a way to remove it? ==
 In the event your image looks bad with a border, you can use the markup "{{{borderless:myimage.png}}}" in place of "{{{attachment:myimage.png}}}" and that will remove the default border.  In most every case an image looks good with a border (especially in the case of photographs), so keep this in mind.
 == How do I force a one-lined return? ==
 {{{[[BR]]}}} will force a single-return.  Normally, just put two returns between blocks of text.  It's more readable that way.  Sometimes you need to use {{{[[BR]]}}} for pretty looking layout, such as in a table (which don't yet support returns properly).
 == How do I rename a page? ==
 Go into Edit and click "Rename".
