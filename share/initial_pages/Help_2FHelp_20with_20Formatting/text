=Text Formatting Rules=

Leave blank lines between paragraphs. Use {{{[[BR]]}}} to insert linebreaks into paragraphs.

Centered text needs arrows around it.  Otherwise it is "left-justified" in layout.
To write ''italics'', enclose the text in double single-quotes
For '''bold''' text, enclose the text in triple single-quotes.
__Underlined text__ needs a double underscore on each side.
You get ^superscripted text^ by enclosing it in caret characters,
and ,,subscripts,, have to be embedded in double commas.
--XStrikethroughX-- text needs two dashes and an X.

= Examples =

'''Centered Text'''
To get "I am centered." to appear in the middle of the line, you must type:
{{{
-->I am centered.<--
}}}
Your result will be this:
-->I am centered.<--

'''Strikethrough'''
To change the sentence "I am not available." to read "I am --XnotX-- available.", add two dashes and an X around the word "not":
{{{
I am --XnotX-- available.
}}}

'''Inline Text'''
 To insert text (inline) without reformatting in a {{{monospace font}}}, use three curly braces like this:
{{{
{{{'''No''' markup here! [[Iamamacro]]}}}
}}}

Your result will be this:

{{{'''No''' markup here! [[Iamamacro]]}}}

__4.__  Block of mixed code example.  The first section is the code and the resulting section shows how it renders on the page:

=== Mix Match ===
{{{
__Mixing__ ''italics'' and '''bold''':
 * '''''Mix''' at the beginning''
 * '''''Mix'' at the beginning'''
 * '''Mix at the ''end'''''
 * ''Mix at the '''end'''''

You might recall ''a''^2^ `+` ''b''^2^ `=` ''c''^2^ from your math lessons, unless your head is filled with H,,2,,O.
}}}

=== EXAMPLE DISPLAY BELOW ===

__Mixing__ ''italics'' and '''bold''':
 * '''''Mix''' at the beginning''
 * '''''Mix'' at the beginning'''
 * '''Mix at the ''end'''''
 * ''Mix at the '''end'''''

You might recall ''a''^2^ `+` ''b''^2^ `=` ''c''^2^ from your math lessons, unless your head is filled with H,,2,,O.
