We call a page "wanted" when there are links made to it but the page does not yet exist.  By creating a wanted page you're adding something that others had probably desired to see on the wiki.

This list is only advisory: '''just because a page is listed here does not make it necessary.''' Look carefully at the pages that link to it and use your judgment.
