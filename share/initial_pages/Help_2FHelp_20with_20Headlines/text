= Section Headings =
You can create headings by equal signs. The wiki supports up to five heading levels. In HTML, this is <h1> through <h5>. The heading text is between those markers, separated by a single space.

Headings are useful because they help divide a page's content.  Headings also show up in the {{{[[TableOfContents]]}}} ["Help/Help with Macros" macro].  When headings are used next to a ["Help/Help with Images" thumbnail images], "clear" the text and create a functional break in the text flow.

For more information on the possible markup, see ["Help/Help on Editing" Help on Editing].

=== Examples ===
{{{
 = Heading Level 1 =
 == Heading Level 2 ==
 === Heading Level  3 ===
 ==== Heading Level  4 ====
 ===== Heading Level  5 =====
}}}

=== Example Output ===
 = Heading Level 1 =
 == Heading Level 2 ==
 === Heading Level  3 ===
 ==== Heading Level  4 ====
 ===== Heading Level  5 =====


Use the biggest header, {{{= Heading Level 1 =}}}, for creating your initial sections then smaller headers for sub-sections.

To indent a headline just but a space (or multiple spaces) in front of it:

{{{
== Not indented ==

  == indented ==
}}}

Displays as:

== Not indented ==

  == indented ==

This is useful for organizing headers.  The more spaces put in front of a headline the more it is indented.

= Horizontal Rules =
You can insert a horizontal rule by placing a series of dashes into the page:

{{{
----
}}}

displays as:

----

Four of more dashes can be used.
