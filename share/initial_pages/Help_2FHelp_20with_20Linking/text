= How to Make Links =

For internal wiki links, use brackets with quotes.  For external links use brackets '''without''' quotes.

== Internal Wiki Links==
Enclosing a sequence of characters in square brackets and double quotes {{{["like this"]}}} makes it link to that page.  To create a link with alternative text, use {{{["like this" alternative text]}}}.

== External Links ==
Enclosing a sequence of characters in square brackets {{{[http://liketh.is]}}} makes it link to that page. To create a link with alternative text, use {{{[http://liketh.is alternative text]}}}.

== Links Within a Page (Anchor links)==
First you must create an 'anchor'.  To create an anchor use: {{{[[Anchor(anchorname)]]}}} Then to use the anchor, create an anchor link: {{{[#anchorname]}}}. To create an anchor link with alternative text, use {{{[#anchorname alternative text]}}}.

For example:  There has been an anchor with the label ''end'' placed at the very end of this page.  If I write {{{[#end the end of the page!]}}} it displays as:  [#end the end of the page!]  Go ahead and try it out.
