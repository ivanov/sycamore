Macros are ''magic'' things you insert into a page to perform some special function.  They look {{{[[LikeThis]]}}}.

== Available Macros ==
  * {{{[[Anchor(anchorname)]]}}} --- defines an anchor. Use {{{[#anchorname Link Text]}}} to jump to said anchor. Note that ''everything'' is case senstive and that the anchor is defined with double brackets {{{[[]]}}} but called with single {{{[]}}} brackets.
  * {{{[[Comments(Leave your comments here)]]}}} --- makes a comments box, but with text other than "Comments", like at the bottom of this page.
  * {{{[[Date]]}}} --- current date, e.g. [[Date]] '''Note''': These macros are not really relevant on Davis Wiki.  They are useful when you want to write a time relative to different timezones.
    * {{{[[Date(1)]]}}} --- tomorrow's date (I guess), e.g. [[Date(1)]]
    * {{{[[DateTime]]}}} --- current date/time: [[DateTime]]
  * {{{[[FootNote(This is the footnote text)]]}}} --- creates a Footnote [[FootNote(This is the footnote text)]]
  * {{{[[FootNote]]}}} --- lists the page's footnotes (footnotes appear at the bottom of the page if {{{[[FootNote]]}}} isn't used)
  * {{{[[heart]]}}} --- creates a [[heart]]
  * {{{[[Image(image_name.jpg, thumbnail, noborder, left/right, "Caption including ["Wiki" links]")]]}}} --- see ["Help/Help with Images" Help with Images]
  * {{{[[Include(pagename)]]}}} -- Includes the contents of page pagename into the current page.  People have been using the following, as well:
  * {{{[[LinksHere]]}}} provides a list of pages that link to the current page
    * {{{[[[LinksHere(pagename)]]}}} provides list of pages that link to an arbitrary wiki page
  * {{{[[MailTo(somebody AT yahoo DOT com)]]}}} --- obscures an email address (sort of) from people who aren't logged in (like those harvesting email addresses for spam), looks like [[MailTo(somebody AT yahoo DOT com)]] to you.  See [http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/HelpOnMacros/MailTo MoinMoin's page on MailTo].
  * {{{[[PageCount]]}}} How many pages are in the wiki?  [[PageCount]]; that's how many.
  * {{{[[paypal]]}}} --- "Make a Donation" paypal button
  * {{{[[RandomPage(n)]]}}} --- where n is a number of links to randomly selected wiki pages
  * {{{[[RandomQuote(pagename)]]}}} --- also works for random images. The page that this references should just be a list of whatever you want to randomly select.
  * {{{[[Stats(Username)]]}}}
  * {{{[[stop]]}}} -- creates a box to link it to a "/Talk" page.  Used when there is a big dispute among users on the content of a page.
  * {{{[[SystemInfo]]}}} is disabled.
  * {{{[[TableOfContents]]}}} creates a table of contents based on the {{{= title =}}} headers on the page. It indents based on the number of equal signs.

=== Style and Formatting "Macros" ===
 * {{{[[BR]]}}} --- force a hard return (but trouble when formatting near images and thumbnails)
 * {{{[[nbsp]]}}} --- adds a single blank space.
