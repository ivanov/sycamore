A marketing campaign put on by Christian student organizations in early 2002. The simple slogan ''I Found It'' was printed on flyers, silkscreened on bright orange shirts, and scribbled on chalkboards. Students wondered what the ''I Found It'' slogan meant and what it was trying to sell. After weeks of masking the campus with their slogan and keeping their interest a secret, the Christian organization revealed that what they found was Jesus Christ. 

Whether or not the campaign managed to convert students is hard to say, but it kept students talking and interested in the ''I Found It'' phenomenon. The campaign was spoofed by the humorous ["AS Papers"] publication ["The Sneeze"]. There was also a shirt by an anonymous designer that simply said ''I Smoked It''.

A couple of the parodies that were spotted include:
 * I lost it. ''(in the insane sense)''
 * I lost it at UC Davis. ''(in the virginity sense)''
