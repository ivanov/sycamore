Drink special calendar:

== Tuesday ==
  * ["Woodstock's Pizza"] - Some sort of "buy a glass" deal (cover charge) and get cheap beer.

== Wednesday ==
  * ["G Street Pub"] - $1 pints of Pabst and Miller Lite, $2 wells (no cover)
  * ["Sophia's Thai Kitchen" Sophia's] - $1 Well drinks, MGD and Miller Light (cover)
  * ["Sudwerk"] - $1 Pints ($3 cover)
      ["JaimeRaba" jr]: ''Bonus Tip: Come before 9 to avoid covers.''
      ["JabberWokky" jw]: ''Radlers (half Martzen, half lemonade) and hard ciders are $2.  The parmasian garlic fries are great.''

== Thursday ==
  * ["Soga's"] - Discount hurricanes  
      ["JaimeRaba" jr]: ''They don't put 151 in their Hurricanes unless you pay extra.''

== Friday ==
  * ["The Graduate"] - 7 well drinks for the price of 1 from 10pm-10:30pm,.. then fewer drinks for the same price each ½ hour later. 
      ["JaimeRaba" jr]: ''This is really stupid because it encourages people to drink a lot, way too quickly.  Why not a single price for a more reasonable period.''

      ["DanMasiel" dm]: ''this isn't the only stupid thing about the Grad.''

      ["JaimeRaba" jr]: ''Amen.''


Note:  these specials are usually only at night.
