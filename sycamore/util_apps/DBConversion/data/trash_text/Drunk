By now we have all seen the "["0 - 3 at UCD" 0-3 at UCD]" slogan. Those numbers are questionable taking into account the context (UCD). First many people don't even touch ["Alcohol"]. Second, at many large parties getting more than three drinks is impossible unless you bring your own emergency stash like I do. Lastly, there are so many lightweights at Davis 3 drinks is all many people need to get pickled! I don't believe this 0-3 nonsense. What would be more constructive would be to see how many drinks a person would drink if they had the choice.  --["ErnBro"]
