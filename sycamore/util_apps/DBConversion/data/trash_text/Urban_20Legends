 * '''Girl's Face on Side of Tercero B''' - legend has it that a girl living on the second floor of Tercero B leapt to her death (from a second floor?!).  The faint image of her face later become apparent on the wall - or it maybe it was that her friends painted her face on the wall, it was later painted over, and reappeared (which would make complete sense as one can often see the vague impression of underlying layers of paint).

       ''When I was a freshman in Tercero C, I heard a different version of this story.  The girl's face CAN be seen from outside, but it is painted on the underside of a third-story awning on Tercero A, facing C building.  The story that we were told was that many years ago, two identical twin girls lived in the room where the painting is located.  One evening, one twin was out at her boyfriend's house while the other twin was asleep in their room.  Supposedly at 3 am or something, she suddenly woke up, opened up her window, leaned out from her top bunk bed, and started drawing this image of a face on the underside of the awning.  She didn't know what possessed her to do it but she couldn't make herself stop.  At some point she finished, looked at the picture, and thought that it was funny that it resembled herself.  She went back to sleep and was awakened at 7 am the next morning by a phone call.  It was her mother, calling to tell her that her twin sister had been killed in a car crash coming home from her boyfriend's that last night at about 3 am.  She was so stricken with grief that she leapt to her death from the third floor window.  Legend has it that the image has been painted over every year, but somehow, the face mysteriously reappears through the paint.  I have no idea if this story is true, but it used to scare the heck out of me as a freshman.  -- ["KayRide"] ''
         ''WTF?  I was in Tercero B (IS '96-'97) and this is the first I've heard of it.'' -- ["NicoleTheWonderNerd"]
           ''I think it's more recent than that.  I'm not sure, though.'' -- ["MikeIvanov"]
                '' I heard from several RA friends that it was in A building rather than B''--["LizethCazares"] 
 * '''Suicide note in the Malcom Hall elevator shaft''' - Back when I was a freshman living on Malcom 3 it was brought to my attention that if you take the elevator to the 5th floor and look up through the crack between the door and the wall, writing is visible on the ceiling of the elevator shaft. It said somthing to the effect of "what did I do wrong? why do you all hate me?". Legend has it that a girl hung herself in the elevator shaft shortly after writing the letter. I haven't actually been in Malcom for about 3 years so the writing may be gone by now. -- ["DanMasiel"]

=== Greek Legends ===

 * Any Greeks care to spill the beans?


== Actually True ==
 * '''Lands deeded with stipulations'''
 * '''"Square Tomatos"''' - were invented here.  Most tomatoes one finds in a grocery store are "square" tomatoes.  They are more robust than (round?) tomatoes, eliminating a formerly significant problem of tomatoes breaking during harvesting.
 * '''["Sword and Sandals"]''', ["Campus" UCD's] very own secret society
 * '''Radioactive Beagles burried on on ["UC Davis"] property''' - from [http://www.weiss.com/publications/poll_prev.pdf this report]:
   The former Laboratory for Energy-Related Health Research is a 15-acre site located on part of the University of California, Davis campus...The Atomic Energy Commission and Department of Energy sponsored experiments at LEHR during the 1960s through the 1980s. These experiments consisted primarily of exposing beagle dogs to strontium-90 and radium–226 to extrapolate the human effects from exposure to low levels of radiation. Waste from these research activities was processed in a Radium/Strontium Treatment System... Waste was also buried in the southwest corner of the site in unlined trenches (Southwest Trenches).
 A person by the name of Chris Watson also claims to have [http://www.thebicyclingguitarist.net/beagles/daiquiri.htm owned a UC Davis radioactive Beagle.]
