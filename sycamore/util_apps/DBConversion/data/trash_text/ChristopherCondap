Describe ChristopherCondap here.

Christopher Condap is an Engineering Mathematics: Mathematics and Statistics major at the University of Caifornia at Berkeley.  What he is doing on a Davis Wiki is the subject of great controversy, but most people attribute it to the fact that he has far too much spare time.  He is currently pursuing a minor in Electical Engineering and Computer Science, which (quite possibly) makes his major and minor the longest string of charcters of any combination of two majors and minors:

"Engineering Mathematics: Mathematics and Statistics; Electrical Engineering and Computer Science."

Christopher Condap sings Tenor II in DeCadence, an A Cappella group from Berkeley, who has performed with ["The Spokes"] on previous occasions.

Christopher Condap makes no apologies at this time, but all complaints may be forwarded through ["SeanRiddle"].
