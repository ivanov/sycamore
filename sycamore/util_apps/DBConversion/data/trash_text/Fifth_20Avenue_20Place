Probably one of the more strangely named apartments in Davis since not only is there no 5th Ave. but its address is not even on 5th St.

This complex features a pool that is visible from ["Pole Line Rd."] where most other complexes have pools surrounded by buildings, and a sculpture of a woman in bronze standing on two girders stacked on top of one another. The pool and the two story buildings on this site were added around 1999. ''(please check)''

Fifth Avenue Place is conveniently located across from the ["DMV"] and ["Post Office"], and just down the street from the ["Davis Police Department"].
