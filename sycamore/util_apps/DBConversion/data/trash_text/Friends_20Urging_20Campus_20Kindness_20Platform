This is the official platform of the ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"] ["ASUCD"] ["Senate"] ["Slate" slate].  This text is not for the faint of heart, but it is the source for those who want to examine the platform in depth.  Those who want to have a more cursory look at what the ["Slate"] stands for should look at ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness Issues"].

[[TableOfContents]]


= Student Government for All Students = 
  Downstairs Office Hours:: Very few students know what the ["ASUCD"] ["Senate"] actually does; even fewer know how to contact their senators.  We at ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"] plan to hold office hours on the ["Quad"], or at ASUCD's office on the first floor of the ["Memorial Union" MU] during inclement weather.  In this way, we will better be able to connect to students.  All you have to do is walk by the ["Memorial Union" MU] at lunch time, and a Senator will be available to talk about the issues you care about.

  ASUCD Documents Available Online:: Currently, very few government documents are online.  Only bills already passed by the ["Senate"] and signed by the ["ASUCD President" President] are online &#8211; but wouldn't you like to know about that $42,000 laser printer before they buy it?  Many documents are only available on the third floor of the ["Memorial Union" MU], and you have to ask to look at them, as they are not on public display.  Making ["ASUCD"] budgets, upcoming ["Senate"] bills, ["Senate"] agendas, and ["ASUCD Court" ASUCD Court] documents available online is a good remedy to an administration which has repeatedly broken the public trust.

  ASUCD Documents Available at Senate Meetings:: Whenever we attend the ["Senate"], there are never enough agendas available for everyone.  Those with their own laptops may be able to access them if they are available online, as mentioned above.  However, we would like a laptop and a printer available at ["Senate"] Meetings, so that no student is left out of the proceedings.  In this way, everyone can understand the process, comment, and help build better bylaws &#8211; without needing to waste paper!

  Promote Interactions with Student Clubs:: Student clubs are one of the most important aspects, and have a variety of needs.  Since these organizations are the best place for students to have a collective voice in Student government, we have already passed a provision in the Electoral Reform bill to allow ["Student Organizations"] to endorse candidates.  We will cooperate with Senator ["Janine Fiel"] and seek to hear the opinions of many different campus clubs.

  Senate Meetings in the Coffee House:: We feel that the ["ASUCD"] government spends way too much time on the third floor of the ["Memorial Union" MU].  By moving the ["Senate"] Meetings into the ["Coffee House"], we can promote ["ASUCD"], increase attendance, and accommodate more people.  This may require meetings to start at 6 PM instead of 5:30 PM, but this change is a small sacrifice compared to the input of the people.


= Commissions and Committees =
  Merge Health and Wellbeing Committee into Gender and Sexuality Commission:: The ["Health and Wellbeing Committee"] has only one or two projects every year, and yet the members are paid and the unit has a budget.  We think that we need to stop this piece of government pork and reorganize the committee's duties into the duties of the ["Gender and Sexuality Commission"]. As health is a major issue in sexuality, we feel that this ["Gender and Sexuality Commission" GASC] is the best equipped to deal with the mission of promoting health in general.  In addition, it would lend credibility to the unit, which comes under frequent fire from those with less kinky leanings. Also, after the merger, we will support renaming the ["Gender and Sexuality Commission"] into something more inclusive if there is enough impetus to do so.

  Increase Gender and Sexuality Commission's Budget:: Cost of one fire truck for ["Aggie Pack"] to launch tube socks: $5,000.  Annual budget of the ["Gender and Sexuality Commission"]: $3,099.  We believe that the ["Senate"] has misplaced its priorities in the past by promoting special interests such as ["Aggie Pack"] rather than funding projects which benefit a large number of students. ["Gender and Sexuality Commission" GASC] projects are educational as well as entertaining, and provide a lot more quality to student life than getting hit in the head by a tube sock.

  Senators at Commission Meetings:: One of the problems that is almost routine in ["Senate"] is the lack of Senators at Commission meetings.  These commissions are the heart and soul of ["ASUCD" ASUCD's] activities at ["UC Davis"]. We promise that our ["Slate" slate] members will attend more commission meetings, so that we will be able to make informed decisions on important issues.  We also promise to read all of the legislation before we come to ["Senate"] meetings. That should be a no-brainer, but it is far too often an issue at ["Senate"] meetings. 


= ASUCD Budget =
  Fiscal Responsibility:: We promise to stop wasteful spending, because your tuition keeps increasing due to the State of California's financial difficulties.  Yet a part of your tuition goes to pay for ["ASUCD"] programs, to the tune of $105.  Though we hope to be able to return part of this money to you, the least we can do is to be fiscally responsible in how we spend your hard-earned (or hard-Direct Loaned) money.

  Stopping Wasteful Spending:: During the last year at ["Senate"], some very odd projects got approved.  The foremost of these lapses in senatorial judgment was the purchase of a fire truck for ["Aggie Pack"].  We would not oppose the truck if it was intended to put out fires, but this truck is intended to rain down tube socks on the heads of Aggie fans.  Tube socks, for God's sake! Even worse, the truck isn't even working yet! Recently, the ["Senate"] passed a bill to allocate $80 to purchase a big sign saying "ASUCD Senator Office Hours" for having office hours on the quad. The problem: they already had such a sign, which was in perfectly usable condition but hasn't been used in years. The bill was passed unanimously with the old sign in the room, so ["RevChad"] and ["RobRoy"] permanently borrowed without permission the old sign with plans to protest this wasteful spending by using only the old sign should they win senate seats. ["ASUCD"] should focus projects that benefit students, not special interests and absurd redundancy.

  Cheaper ASUCD Retreats:: Currently, there is an ["ASUCD"] government retreat which takes place in Lake Tahoe and costs you, the student, $2,000 of ["ASUCD"] funds.  I'm sure everyone involved in ["ASUCD"] enjoys the cabins and the catering, and I'm sure it helps everyone to become friends &#8211; just like our ["Slate" slate]!  But the problem is that it doesn't benefit anyone but the student government officials themselves.  We believe that we can become friends without spending so much money.  We urge the ["Senate"] to show kindness to the campus by holding a retreat somewhere far cheaper, maybe as a camping trip or on campus.  Some members of the ["Slate" slate] suggested holding it at the ["Pirate Ship"], but for some reason #1 candidate ["Rob Roy"] didn't like us volunteering his house.  We've been told that there is an extra mattress there for those who pass out from overlegislation.

  Two-thirds Amendment for Increasing Fees:: Currently, ["ASUCD"] has the highest fees of any student body in the U.C. system.  Due to two initiatives that have passed in recent years &#8211; the Move to D1 and the FACE Initiative &#8211; your fees have shot up dramatically.  Since voter turnout is so small in ["ASUCD"] elections, a minority of people can easily overwhelm a majority of students who don't want the initiative but are not informed enough to vote.  We believe that a fee increase should represent everyone's desire for a bigger student government, and so we propose an ["ASUCD"] Constitutional Amendment that will require two-thirds of voters to increase the amount you pay in fees.

  No Embezzlement:: For those of you who still think fondly of the ["SOSSS" Students for an Orwellian Student Senate Slate] (SOSSS), we still carry some of their traditions forward to this day.  One of those traditions is a promise that every member of the ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"] ["Slate" slate] will uphold: We doublepluspromise that we will embezzle unmore than other candidates.  If you're wondering if this is really an issue, I have two words for you: ["Black Caesar" Tiqula Bledsoe].  You can look him up.

  Support Community Projects:: We have a strong sense of activism, and we feel that ["ASUCD"] funds should be directed towards resources for the campus community in Davis or the world at large. For instance, The House, DavisWiki, and the Counseling Center all provide a great deal of Campus Kindness.  But we should not isolate ourselves from the world community either; ["ASUCD"] money should be spent to help tsunami relief and future natural disasters of that scale.

  Audits of ASUCD Units:: ["ASUCD"] has many units, and many of them are quite good at serving the undergraduates here at UCD: The ["Coffee House"], ["Unitrans"], and the ["Whole Earth Festival"], and ["The California Aggie"].  However, some programs really need a lot of research to see whether they truly serve the campus community.  ["AGTV"] is a good opportunity to work on television, but do their ratings justify the program?  Campus safety is an issue important to many of us, but is the ["Campus Safety"] Unit working in an effective way to increase safety?  We are not afraid to investigate fully before we come to any decision, as it is the job of the ["Senate"] to make sure that your money is serving you.


= External Affairs =
  The Fight for Your Right to Party:: John Locke once said that "the right to party" is alienable, and has to be fought for (Stewart et al. 2004).  This fact is very apparent in Davis, a community divided into students and residents.  The residents, who control most of the city government in Davis, refuse to acknowledge many of the aspects that shape college life.  But candidate ["Rob Roy"], as well as the rest of the ["Slate" slate], will fight for your right to party.  In fact, ["Rob Roy"] has a vested interest in it, as concerts at his house, the ["Pirate Ship"], rack up hundreds of dollars in noise violations.  The ["Davis Police Department" Davis Police] enforce a strict policy against open containers of  ["Alcohol" alcohol], even when having an open bottle of beer is harming no one.  If elected, we will lobby to resolve these issues by working with the Davis ["City Council"] and create an environment in Davis that includes students.

  End Davis Apartheid:: Davis is a house divided against itself.  Many students feel as if the residents wish to exclude them, and to make life difficult.  As students and residents have different priorities, it is important that both groups are represented on Davis ["City Council"].  However, the City Council elections are held in June, during finals week when many students aren't interested voting.  These elections need to be moved to November, when most other elections are held and students are most interested in voting.  We will also lobby for the City to adopt ["Choice Voting"] for Council elections.

  Creating a Davis Night Life:: If only there was a good place for people to perform and have a good time in Davis, there wouldn't be the need for so many house parties.  If Davis had a nightclub, residents wouldn't be disturbed and Davis would have an actual nightlife.  We propose that we investigate the creation of a nightclub in the city of Davis, owned and operated by ["ASUCD"].  We will also sell ["Alcohol" beer] and ["Alcohol" wine] produced on campus by the Food Science, Viticulture, and Enology departments.  This is our most ambitious proposal, and we will seek private investment and a business plan to create a profitable venture.

  Lobbying for Students and Ethics of Lobbying:: We promise that we will only lobby for issues that relate directly to students and student life.  This includes promoting school diversity, reducing student fees, and support for union labor on campus.  However, we will work hard to make sure that we do not endorse candidates for public office or issues that most students will not support.  This is not to say that we won't take a stand for issues we believe in.  We plan on using the ["Senate"] as a soapbox on which to present our issues, without making the ["Senate"] vote.  In this way, we can balance activism with responsibility to all of the students we represent.

  No Dead Day on Saturday:: The ["UC Davis" University] schedule should offer a real day off between classes and their finals, not a lame excuse for a Dead Day on Saturday.  They should know that we already have that day off, but we really could use an extra day to study.  If the University wants us to do well on our finals, we believe that they should give us an actual Dead Day for studying.  This ["Slate" slate] is committed to lobbying the ["UC Davis" University] to give us a real Dead Day.


= ASUCD Internal Reforms =
  More Power to the Judicial Branch:: The Judicial Branch has very little power in ["ASUCD"], and that has clearly caused an imbalance of power in the student government.  The other two branches have been free to create many controversies due to the lack of oversight: the ["Election Statement Controversy"], the ["Campaigning in Dorms Controversy"], and ["Lamargate"].  We seek to restore the power of the ["ASUCD Court"] so that procedural errors can be avoided in the ["Senate"], Commissions, Committees, and the ["ASUCD President" Presidency].  This might require a public prosecutor and a public defender to work for ["ASUCD"] to bring more cases before problems arise.  It also might require ["ASUCD"] be given back the elections jurisdiction.  We promise that we will make the ["ASUCD Court" Judiciary] a working branch of the student government.

  Reduced Power for the Executive:: Over his term, ["ASUCD President"] ["Kalen Gallagher"] has had free rein over all of ["ASUCD"].  He vetoed legislation which would have kept your fees from increasing in the future.  The ["ASUCD Court" Judicial Branch] cannot author legislation because of ["Kalen Gallagher" Kalen's] veto, but the ["ASUCD President" Executive] can write as much legislation as they want.  The office of the ["ASUCD President" President] has a $20,000 slush fund, to do with as he wants.  Many of the autocrats in ["ASUCD"] have been removed, such as "Queen" ["Vicki Swett" Victoria Swett] and "["Black Caesar"]" Tiqula Bledsoe.  Clearly, there needs to be more oversight of the ["ASUCD President" President] in the future.  The ["Countback"] Amendment, discussed below, is one important way to accomplish this.

  The Countback Amendment:: ["Choice Voting" Choice voting] is a brilliant system, because it allows you to determine a lot about voter preferences.  When a senator resigns, the next person who would have been elected fills the empty seat, if the ["Countback"] Amendment to the ["ASUCD"] Constitution is adopted.  As ["Kalen Gallagher"] has filled 4 of the 12 ["Senate"] seats due to resignations, power has shifted to the ["ASUCD President" President] and away from the people.  This amendment by the ["Davis College Green Party"] would change this; it has our full support.  In addition, we will continue our pursuit of elections reform, if need arises.

  Rewrite the Senate's Standing Rules:: The way the ["Senate"] currently works, abstentions are treated the same as "no" votes; bills must be approved by a majority of ["Senate"] seats.  Thus, if there is a vacancy in the ["Senate"], it essentially counts as a "no" vote.  Some bills have failed even with a majority of seated Senators in support the bills.  This is extraordinarily stupid.  No elected body works like this.  Majority calculations should be calculated based on the number actually participating in the vote, and it will be if we're elected.

  Expand the Senate to 18 Seats:: To take full advantage of ["Choice Voting"], we need to have more senators to represent every group on campus better.  Campus conservatives have a senator &#8211; why can't engineers?  By putting 9 people in ["Senate"] seats each election (18 total), we ensure that a more diverse group is put in the ["Senate"].  Diversity of opinions is what makes a university great, and will make the ["Senate"] much better informed about all of campus life.

  Protect Freedom of Speech:: We believe the Freedom of Speech is the foundation of a free society, and that this right to expression must include Freedom of Emotional Speech as well.  However, some emotionally charged words have been censored at ["UC Davis" UCD] and in the ["Senate"], most notably by ["Paloma Perez"]. That is not like ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"] at all.  We believe that Freedom of all speech must be protected at ["Senate"] meetings, election forums, campaigns, and Write Club events.  Far too many have been censored so far, to the detriment of us all.

  Stop Moving/Threatening to Move the Project Compost office, for Christ's Sake:: Not much more needs to be said, except that the ["Project Compost"] office clearly belongs where it is, underground.


= Campus Infrastructure =
  Remote print stations:: We think you should be able to print to ["Campus" campus] from anywhere, whether it's from the ["Campus" campus] wireless network or from home.  We will make the printer drivers available online so anyone on the wireless network can print without taking up space in already crowded computer labs. One day, printing on campus will become as easy as {{{lpr -PMUremote foo.pdf}}} is!

  Sanitary Seat Covers in Restrooms:: For some reason, there are no seat covers in ["Shields Library" Shields Library], one of the ["Campus" campus's] dirtiest ["Cleanest Bathrooms" bathrooms] and most highly trafficked buildings.  They say that they don't have the budget for seat covers, but there are seat covers in ["Mrak Hall"].  We will lobby the ["UC Davis" University] administration to put seat covers everywhere, as it is such a simple sanitary device that all people should have access to them when they need them. If the administration is unwilling or unable to accomodate the sanitary needs of the students, staff, and faculty that frequent ["Shields Library" Shields Library], we will take it upon ourselves to create a bill to purchase the seat covers and pay for the installation.

  Speed Up Geckomail:: Some of us have noticed that the campus webmail, or Geckomail, has been exceptionally slow lately.  We're not sure where the data bottleneck is, but it would be possible to use ["ASUCD"] funds to purchase a new server if it is needed.  Though truly, it is the ["UC Davis" University's] responsibility to maintain the system, and perhaps a little "encouragement" from student government is all they need to get into action.

  Television in the MU?:: Though the ["SOSSS"] part of our ["Slate" slate] normally supports telescreens, we're not sure the rest of the campus does.  We wish to take a poll of the ["Campus" campus] and ask them, "Do you think that the television in the ["Memorial Union" MU] which broadcasts what is essentially advertising belongs in a university, given how much money it makes for ["ASUCD"]?"  We think your opinion is important, and we will listen to all public opinion polls as they represent the opinion of the campus in general, not just ["ASUCD"] politicos.


= Campus Entertainment =
  Old Firehouse Venue for Music Performances:: A long time ago, one ["Slate" slate] promised the Old Firehouse to be used as a new venue for ["Davis Music Scene"] events.  However, that ["Slate" slate] has a history of breaking the public trust, thus it is not surprising that they broke this campaign promise as well.  Pro-music candidate ["Rob Roy"] will fight for use of this building as a new venue, bringing more culture to ["Campus" campus].

  More Entertainment Council Events:: The ["ASUCD Entertainment Council"] needs more money, so it can put on more events.  This would include more concerts by all kinds of artists not allowed in the Mondavi Center, as well as more free movie previews which have been extremely popular on ["Campus" campus].  We are, after all, the ["Slate" slate] of bread and circuses.


= Student Services =
  More Unitrans or Tipsy Taxi Runs:: We've all been there.  You need a ride on ["Unitrans"] or ["Tipsy Taxi"], and it's nowhere to be found.  ["Unitrans"] runs stop at midnight, and ["Tipsy Taxi"] has only one dispatcher to handle the demand.  However, this is the time when most people will be too drunk to drive home.  We think that there should be increased service at this time to prevent drunk driving and offer more alternative tranportation.  ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"] will investigate this, and see which program would be most effective in transporting people from a party to their homes.  This might require something like a $1 fee for ["Unitrans"] on late runs, but it would be worth it in terms of the safety and kindness you would bring to the campus.  Also, we will investigate Sunday ["Unitrans"] runs (probably (P/Q lines) &#8211; not everyone in Band-uhtrans! could possibly party every weekend.

  Staplers in the Computer Labs:: It should be obvious that people will want to ["Campus Staplers" staple] things in the computer labs after they've printed them out.  However, there are no ["Campus Staplers" staplers] in the labs.  We've heard that they were stolen in the past, and we've come up with a brilliant solution: bolt them down.  We have already written a bill allocating a couple hundred dollars from Capital Reserves to buy some ["Campus Staplers" staplers] for the labs.  Solving the little annoyances in student life should be the domain of student government.

  Promoting Campus Safety:: It seems to us that there are already plenty of programs that increase safety on campus, and few people know about them.  Self-defense classes are taught though the ["Women's Center"], and Aggie Hosts already provides an ["Campus Safety Escort Service" Escort Service] at night.  Publicity of these resources already available to people would really help improve Campus Kindness.  We will also look at funding the Women's Center and the ["LGBTRC" LGBT Resource Center] in any programs they have to promote tolerance and decrease sexual assault.

   Book Prices:: It would be nice to take advantage of the free market when it comes to purchasing books for our classes. Currently, most students do not know what books are required for a particular class until the first day of lecture. Usually, there are assignments or readings required relatively soon after that day. This usually leaves just enough time to go to the ["Campus" campus] bookstore to purchase the book at its (relatively high) price. In order to allow students to shop around for the best price from competing vendors, a hallmark of our free market society, we propose that the student government compile a list of all required texts for all possible classes for each quarter and publish them on a central web site, including ISBN numbers, before the start of the quarter to allow all students enough time to look around for the best price. This would increase competition among all vendors and ultimatly lead to lower prices for the students.

  Potential issue: reclaim the 5th floor:: Still researching this one.


= SECRET AGENDA: Campus Kindness =
  Social Revolution:: If there's one thing that Davis needs, it's a social revolution.  We want a new culture, a new philosophy, and a new birth of freedom.  We're not exactly sure how to accomplish this, but it will probably involve pot and/or Project Mayhem.

  More Redwood Trees on Campus:: Okay, we know these trees just suck up the water in the summer, but they're very nice, and add a great feel to the ["Campus" campus].  Redwood trees are the heart of California, and have a soul all their own.  Besides, what other contribution can you make that will show ["Campus"] Kindness long after you're dead?

  Terraforming:: We think that life in Davis would be greatly improved if we just installed some hills and an ocean.  A mini-golf course would be great among such features.  As card-carrying members of the Bavarian Illuminati fnord, our slate members will support all current plans for changing Davis' geography, if they exist.

  Clean Up Putah Creek:: Just because of its name, the body of water doesn't have to be as dirty as an old puta.  We'd like the campus to clean it up, and make water actually flow through there.  There is definitely not enough ["Campus"] Kindness for the fish, and we friends are urging more kindness.

Please add any comments/questions below.
[[Comments]]
------
''2005-01-27 22:19:42'' [[nbsp]] You seem confused as to what Putah Creek actually is. I am working on fixing the wiki information. The waterway in the Arboretum is no longer Putah Creek. Putah Creek is the river that runs south of campus. The section near campus is actively managed for environmental quality. There are lots of non-profits and organisations working to better the creek. Improving the Arboretum is a different issue. On a somewhat related note, we should be planting Valley Oaks, not redwoods. --["JackHaskel"]

''2005-01-28 16:05:21'' [[nbsp]] I agree about the oaks. Native plants should be given preference over non-native generally, and the main focus should be on minimizing upkeep costs such as watering. --["RevChad"]
