You know the saying, "Don't drink the water."? That applies in Davis. Buy yourself a water filter ASAP.
        * An adage addendum: "If it's brown, drink it down.  If it's black, send it back" - Davis tap water is some of the hardest, most metallic-tasting water arround. - ["BrandonKeene"]
        * Actually, the water has [http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ps/ddwem/chemicals/chromium6/Cr+6backgroundinfo.htm Chromium 6] in it.  You know, the substance that was the basis for the [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0195685/ Erin Brockovich movie], where a bunch of people were mysteriously getting sick and dying and whatnot.  Of course, there's way less in Davis water than the locale in the movie (which, incidentally, was based on a true story), but somehow I don't think Britas filter it out. - ["JaimeRaba" jr] 
        * I think Davis water has flavor. Bottled water is for the faint of heart or the tourists traveling in third world countries. You think Ernest Hemingway drank bottled water? Get some cahonies and gulp it down right from the tap. - ["RobRoy"] 
        * Davis water is much better than plenty of places in this country, which has better water than most places in the world.  Get over it, or get tea (which, not coincidently is popular in those places with bad water). - ["JabberWokky"] 
        * After a night of hard drinking, Davis water is downright wonderful.  Relax and enjoy it.  --["ChrisTakemura" ct]
        * The City of Davis publishes to every household, anually, statistics on the non reclaimed city water (which consists mostly of tap).  The breakdown is in two categories; regulated (health related) and non-regulated (taste, odor, color related).  As far as all of the regulated ratings go, Davis is well within regulations and does not even come close to violating ANY of the health standards.  However, as far as the unregulated goes, the ratings are pretty appauling and could use some improvements.  In summary, it's not the tastiest water around, but there should be no long term health consequences. (Unless you think the Communists are behind flouridation - and even if they are not - flouride is still a toxic industrial waste substance that should not be ingested and has very questionable health benefits - but that is more political than anything else) --["ChristopherMcKenzie"]--

From the [http://www.city.davis.ca.us/aboutdavis/cityprofile/index.cfm?topic=2 City of Davis] website:

''"Generally, Davis groundwater is very hard and high in dissolved solids. Selenium and nitrates are two primary substances found in Davis tap water. Selenium is a natural element in the soil which may dissolve into groundwater and nitrates are chemicals that may occur from agricultural irrigation and cultivation of the soil due to fertilizers or leaching of water from septic systems. Both selenium and nitrate levels at all city wells are below the maximum standards set by federal and/or state agencies. Long term development of water wells over 1,500 feet deep is planned to improve the aesthetic characteristics of Davis water."''

and

''"Arsenic and hexavalent chromium levels are relatively low, but may exceed future drinking water limits."''

This is a chunk of water not from the City of Davis system, but from a shallower local aquaifer. It is 8 inches in diameter and consists of hard water that has flaked off the inside of the pipe and has been cemented together by additional deposits. If it had been any prettier it could have been sold at the next ["Whole Earth Festival"].


 * is there any easy way to remove these precipitations?  My water boiler's interior is COATED with these white stuff, and physically scratching them off is time consuming, labor intensive, and also damaging to the interior of my water boiler. - ["PanSola"]
 * ["ACE Hardware"] sells a chemical called CLR which removes calcium, lime and rust. -- ["ArlenAbraham" aa]

Many ["Davis"] residents chose to purchase ["Pure Drinking Water"] at ["Supermarkets"].
