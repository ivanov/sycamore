Date rape can mean all sorts of things and can apply to varying situations.  There is a lot of information avaiable on the [http://www.watchyourdrink.com/ situations that date rape occur in] as well as [http://www.expomed.com/drugtest/clubdrugs.htm the drugs commonly used].

Please note that an email warning about a drug called Progesterex is a hoax. For more information, see [http://hoaxinfo.com/progesterex.htm], [http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1597.html], [http://www.snopes.com/toxins/progest.htm], or if you're still scared, find a professor in the vet school and ask him.

== What you can do ==
 * Never take a drink from someone, fill it up yourself (unless you're watching a licensed bartender).
 * Use the buddy system, watch out for each other and your drinks.
 * Use ["Date Rape Testers"] if you suspect your drink has been tampered with.
 * Only go home with your buddy, a very helpful stranger might have been the one to drug you.
 * Never leave your drink alone.
 * If you black out or become suddenly intoxicated after a little drinking (less than one) something is wrong.
 * Most rapes in general are by people the victim already knows.
 * If you suspect that you've been assaulted/raped, save your clothing and urine as evidence for the police.

''While this is an important topic to about 10k of the people in Davis, is it really something that should have its own page on this Wiki?  It's not quite a '''Davis''' topic.'' --- ["JabberWokky"]

''See, I disagree that everything in daviswiki.org should have something to do with Davis.  I mean, it's an ecyclopedia about the universe from a Davis perspective.  So if there is a Davis perspective, there should be an entry here.  This is a rather generic and bland page, however.  But it could be dressed up.  For example, if there were some Davis stats... that could make it better.'' -- ["JaimeRaba" jr]

''If that were done, it would certainly have to do with Davis, and thus make sense here.  There are better, more updated, and generally more complete general references such as the Wikipedia that make more sense for something like Progesterex.'' -- ["JabberWokky"]

''Agreed.'' -- ["JaimeRaba" jr]
