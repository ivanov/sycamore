In 2004, the ["California Aggie Marching Band Uh"] set a new record by staying and playing at the battle until 2am in the morning.[[BR]]
Not only that, but it was the first battle in like 10 years that was actually won, and not ended in a tie.[[BR]]
(This is true. I know. I was there for all 12 hours of it, playing. - ["ThomasFifield"])[[BR]]

The Picnic Day Battle of the Bands is just like a regular ["Marching Band Battle"], except for this extra special rule:
 * The last song played MUST be ["Aggie Fight"]. And this means that the Aggie Band-uh! wins (again-uh!)(or ties).
