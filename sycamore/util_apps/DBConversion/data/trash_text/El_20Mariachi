attachment:El_Mariachi.jpg

An authentic counter-style taqueria, El Mariachi is arguably the most Mexican of the Mexican restaurants in Davis.

Family owned and operated, El Mariachi features a wide selection of Mexican favorites.  One of the defining characteristics of El Mariachi is its Salsa Bar which features a wide selection of fresh salsas (i.e. strawberry, pumpkin, mango, pineapple, cactus, cucumber, corn, etc.)

This is the only place in ["Davis"] that serves "napoles" cactus in their burritos.  Napoles are uber tasty.

The Tortilla Soup only costs $2 and is pretty good for ["Cheap Food"].

I talked to the owner, he used to be (or maybe still is) a custodian at ["Tercero Residence Halls" Tercero].  He makes everything from the best ingredients; all of the meats and vegetables are all bought fresh daily to ensure the best possible taste.  For the price and the quality it is the best, healthiest Mexican restaurant in the world, and ["Davis"] is lucky to have it.  Plus they have fantastic vegetarian options.
