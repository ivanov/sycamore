The Colleges at La Rue (more commonly known simply as "The Colleges") are on ["Campus"] meaning that it is in a great location.  It is directly across the street from the new ["ARC"] but offers its own fitness room.  The apartments come pre-wired for ethernet, and residents connect to ["ResNet"], making UC Davis their official ISP. Electricity is provided to the apartment complex by the University as well (but not included in the monthly rent). For those who have trouble paying their bill on time, this is a boon -- the University will never shut off your power. Instead, the fees simply continue to accrue. [http://myphone.ucdavis.edu Phone Service] is also available through the University, once again similar to the dorms. The apartments also come pre-wired for Cable, but do not include any type of Cable service (not even Student Housing TV).

A one bedroom here is >$700 and  the large 4 bedroom apartment is about $1915 a month, according to their [http://www.tandemproperties.com/colleges/index.html website]
They are the newest apartment complex that is managed by ["Tandem Properties"]

The Colleges also runs a "Living and Learning Community" which offers various extracurricular programs and events throughout the academic year. All residents are required to be in one of their Communities. The Communities include Leadership and Development, Education in the 21st Century, Global Learning & Foreign Language Enhancement, and the new Community for the Arts.

Many find participation in the programs to be cumbersome, others enjoyable, and still others treat it simply as part of "the price of living at The Colleges." The demand to live at this complex is quite high, and so people's chances for living here are much better if they know someone who already resides there, and can be added to their lease as a roommate.  Current residents also get priority when moving to a different appartment inside the complex, such as upgrading from a one to two bedroom.
