The Avid reader is Davis' independent new bookstore.  They have a decent selection and the staff is always friendly. Even better, if you're looking for something ["Living Cheaply" free] to do, the store hosts readings by local and touring authors.


They also have a satelite shop, ["The Avid Reader for Younger Readers"] located on the ["E Street Plaza"]
