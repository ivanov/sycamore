The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department offers three major courses of study: 1) Electrical Engineering, 2) Computer Engineering, 3) Electrical Engineering/Material Science and Engineering.  The department is based out of ["Kemper Hall"] with their office on the second floor in the east wing.  They are a part of the ["College of Engineering"].

== Student Perspective on Courses ==
=== Lower Division ===
''ENG 6 - Engineering Problem Solving''
 * This class can be very boring.  The professor just goes over code the whole time and if you already understand it, then it is probably not worth your while to attend.

''ENG7. Technology and Culture of the Internet''

''ENG17. Circuits I''
 * Introductory circuits course. Mandatory for all engineering majors (I believe). Covers basic analog circuit analysis. You know, resistors, inductors, capacitors, KVL, KCL, nodal analysis, mesh-current analysis. This class is often hated by non-EE engineers. Ha ha! No, really. I understand. It's boring.

''EEC1. Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering''

''EEC70. Computer Structure and Assembly Language''
 * It's an assembly language course (dur). Not terribly hard, especially when compared with ECS50 (I think that's the one). They used to teach with RISC, but have recently moved to an Intel instruction set.

''EEC73. Applications of Object-Oriented Programming''

=== Upper Division ===
''ENG100. Electronic Circuits and Systems''
 * A final electronics course (after E17) for non-EE/CE engineering majors. Covers both analog and digital.

''ENG191. Communication Strategies in Engineering''

''EEC100. Circuits II''
 * Continuation of ENG17 for EE/CE majors. Same book as E17. Covers frequency-dependent circuit analysis - passive filters, op-amps, and active filters.

''EEC101. Gateway to Electrical and Computer Engineering''
 * Soon to be removed from the curriculum (According to Norman Tien, Department Chair, Fall 2004). Was formerly a weeder course.

''EEC106. Introduction to Image Processing and Computer Vision''

''EEC110A. Electronic Circuits I''

''EEC110B. Electronic Circuits II''

''EEC112. Communication Electronics''

''EEC114. Analog Integrated Circuits''

''EEC116. VLSI Design''

''EEC118. Digital Integrated Circuits''
 * Looking at digital circuits with an analog perspective.  It is only three units, but the work you do for it feels like five.

''EEC130A. Introductory Electromagnetics I''
 * Math math math math math math....

''EEC130B. Introductory Electromagnetics II''

''EEC132A. High-Frequency Systems, Circuits and Devices''

''EEC132B. High-Frequency Systems, Circuits and Devices''

''EEC132C. RF Amplifiers, Oscillators, Mixers and Antennas''

''EEC133. Electromagnetic Radiation and Antenna Analysis''

''EEC135. Optical Communications I: Fibers''

''EEC136. Opto-Electronics and Fiber-Optics Laboratory''

''EEC140A. Principles of Device Physics I''
 * Uses a ton of quantum physics.  This must have been the hardest final I have ever had.

''EEC140B. Principles of Device Physics II''

''EEC145A. Solid-State Electronics''

''EEC145B. Solid-State Electronics''

''EEC146A. Integrated Circuits Fabrication''

''EEC146B. Advanced Integrated Circuits Fabrication''

''EEC150A. Introduction to Signals and Systems I''

''EEC150B. Introduction to Signals and Systems II''

''EEC151. Instrumentation Interfacing, Signals and Systems''

''EEC157A. Control Systems''

''EEC157B. Control Systems''

''EEC158 Control Systems Design Methods''

''EEC160. Signal Analysis and Communications''

''EEC165. Statistical and Digital Communication''

''EEC166. Digital Communication Design Techniques''

''EEC167. Telecommunications Measurements and Instrumentation''

''EEC170. Introduction to Computer Architecture''

''EEC171. Parallel Computer Architecture''

''EEC172. Microcomputer-Based System Design''
 * Interesting course.  It combines both software and hardware design.

''EEC180A. Digital Systems I''
 * The labs in this course can be very frustrating.  You will have a million wires going every which way and then the output wont look right.  You'll debug it for hours and find out that your wiring was correct but you just had a faulty chip.  If you're lucky, they won't run out of licenses for the software just when you need it the most.

''EEC180B. Digital Systems II''
 * The computers you use for this class are ancient.  Productivity would increase tenfold if they finally upgraded them from the old HP-UX machines in there.

''EEC183. Testing and Verification of Digital Systems'' 

''EEC194ABC. ["Micromouse" Micromouse Design Project]
 * Fun times for the geeks.

''EEC195ABC. ["Natcar" Natcar Design Project]
