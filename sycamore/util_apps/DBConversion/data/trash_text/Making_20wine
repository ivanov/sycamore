''The most dangerous thing about making your own booze is contamination of harmful bacteria which could give you some nasty food poisoning.'' -- ["ArlenAbraham" aa]

You can also give ["drunk on rice" rice-ahol] a try or ["Brew your own beer" brewing your own beer]


Ingredients:

 *1 Can frozen juice concentrate (defrosted)

 *1 Packet Yeast (wine or bread...whatever works)

 *1 Cup Sugar

 *Juice (preferably matching that of the concentrate)

Okay, so here's the deal. Get some sort of container for your wine, perhaps juice jugs,. or anything that can be decently sealed up. I dont suggest using a bucket.

Next, mix in all the ingredients and stir em up, real good like.

Then put a balloon over the neck of the wine holding jug or container (to trap the gases released).

Wait two weeks for fermentation, then strain out the yeast and chill! In my experience, the best batches have also stayed in the fridge for a few days to settle. Also, the best flavors that i've enjoyed are Cranberry and Cran-Rasberry, so I would suggest going with those. You can try your own, but just keep in mind that it could end in disaster. Trust me, dont try apple. 

Note: It's a good idea to put it somewhere like the garage or hall closet...after a few days your brew will exude the smell of fermentation!!

(More on this later...i have to make sure of the sugar/juice amounts)

'' I had a friend who would make wine in gas containers that he bought at the AMPM.  They are huge and sealable.  Also, for more sweet wine, you can try making it out of Kool Aid and adding the yeast to that and don't let it ferment too long.  It will be less alcoholic, but sweeter to the taste, so it can be a trade off.  When I worked for a winery, we used cold settling to get the yeast out of solution.  A coffee filter should help to get rid of the yeast after that.  A bit of shaking can also help make your wine better to stir up your yeast.  That nasty smell (rotten egg-ish) comes from the yeast, so don't breathe deeply, it stinks.''- ["RohiniJasavala"]

'' This is a pretty sad page considering the fine enology program at UCD. Anyway, here are some points to be aware of:

 * '''It's highly unlikely that you will make anything that will cause blindness.''' This is a tale from the times of prohibition, when bootleggers would sometimes use old car radiators in their distillation process (ethylene glycol anyone?), as well as a variety of other toxic chemicals. Bad news. There's also a bit of Methanol produced in fermentation, but the concentration is ridiculously low. If you're not distilling the beverage (increasing the ["Alcohol"] concentration through removal of water), then there's no problem. Even if you were to distill, it wouldn't be too tough to get rid of the Methanol.
 * For the sake of sanitation and peace of mind, '''don't ferment in non-food-grade containers''' (e.g. gas cans). This just has "bad idea" written all over it.
 * When you're ready to really get started making something, head on over to a brew shop. '''I'd recommend [http://go.to/homebrew_outlet The Original Homebrew Outlet] in Sacramento'''. They have all the supplies you need to get started with wine OR beer at very reasonable prices (~$100 for super-deluxe beer equipment kit). They also have a very helpful and knowledgable staff. At the very least, you can get a food grade bucket to put your frozen juice in..(yuck)
 * '''I've never been carded in a brew shop.''' And I've been to quite a few in California and Washington. The ingredients aren't regulated, the staff doesn't care how old you are (unless you're 12 or something.. college-age is fine), and they're usually very nice people.
 * If you're interested in distillation, check [http://www.homedistiller.org], [http://www.brewhaus.com], and then [http://www.moonshine-still.com/]. The last has two very nice distillation apparatus designs. Illegal in the states, but what's to stop you from reading up on it?''
