Central Davis is an area of ["Davis"] fascinatingly named as such due to the likelyhood of finding it in the middle of any given map of Davis.

The area commonly referred to as "Central Davis" by Davis citizens is bound in the North by West Covell, on the West side by ["Highway 113"], on the South side by ["Russell"] Boulevard, and on the East side by F street.

Central Davis contains a number of valued Davis businesses, delightful ["Parks" parks], schools, and pleasant-looking residences. There're also a bunch of ["Fraternity" fraternities] on ["Russell"], if you're into that sort of thing.
