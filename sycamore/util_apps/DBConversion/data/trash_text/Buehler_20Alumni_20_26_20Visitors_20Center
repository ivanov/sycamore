Located across the ["Arboretum" arboretum] from ["Mrak Hall" Mrak] and next to the ["Mondavi Center"], the Buehler Alumni & Visitors Center is worth visiting to see the sculpture that stands just to the left of the main entry doors.

The rest of the art changes, but the metal horse -["Untitled (Horse), 1992"]- hasn't moved. There are conference rooms and offices and helpful desk staff. If you do stop by take a moment to walk out into their garden and relax for a minute.
