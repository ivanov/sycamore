There are many restaurants labeled as Chinese in Davis.  Even some of the other forms of Asian restaurants tack on "And Chinese Food" somewhere on their signs.  They are definitely not referring to the food that people eat in China, but rather to Americanized Chinese food, which is an entirely different category of food.  This can be done well (although rarely in Davis), but as many Chinese will tell you, there is basically no actual Chinese food served at restaurants in Davis, anyway.  However, this doesn't mean that Americanized Chinese food is necessarily bad.  It's just kind of its own thing.  ["Hunan"] and ["Orange Hut"] are usually suggested as restaurants who do a good job strattling the line between Asian influence and Anglo-American taste buds.  Davis' Chinese restaurants are quite a good deal at lunch time.

''The sad thing is that arguably the most authentic Chinese food in Davis can be gotten at ["Old Teahouse"], in terms of selection and serving food without sweet sauces, although this says little about quality there (which is uneven). For those who truly love authentic Chinese cuisine, it's hard to do much better than ["New Canton"]. Its Chinese name is something like "Tailwind," just to be random, and it is located on Broadway & 26th in Sacramento.  Chef Tony Su used to be Executive Chef at ABC in Milpitas, which is the best Chinese restaurant in the Northern California (sharing this honor also with Hong Kong Flower Lounge in Millbrae).'' --["JaimeRaba" jr]

''2004-11-16 00:44:57'' [[nbsp]] Hong Kong Flower Lounge is pretty impressive.  The lobster and crab were excellent, but the lemon chicken and the rice were pretty bad. - ["MikeIvanov"]------
