The Davis Enterprise is a local newspaper.  It has a smaller circulation than ["The California Aggie"], but the Aggie is free whereas the Enterprise is not. Its national news selection is entirely wire stories, and they often run stories which suggest an anti-student bias (especially concerning ["parties"]). The Enterprise is sometimes accused of failing to balance these anti-student pieces with student perspectives. To be fair, the Enterprise is aimed largely at the non-student population of Davis. Its coverage of high school sports is unmatched. 

The location of the Enterprise was once the Post Office, before the USPS relocated to Fifth and Pole Line.

= Printing Press =
The Davis Enterprise maintains its own printing press, which prints several other papers, including the ["The California Aggie" Aggie], ["King Hall Advocate"], and virtually all [http://asucd.ucdavis.edu/services/publications/aspapers/ AS PAPERs].  It is physically located across the street from the business office. 

This building was the second location of the Enterprise, which is why until recently it said "Davis Enterprise" on the outside.

''2004-11-29 02:44:17'' [[nbsp]] I think there is generally a great divide between Davis students and the population of Davis.  A lot of this is reflected in the [http://californiaaggie.ucdavis.edu/article/?id=6529 apathy] of UCD students, even as regards campus issues, let alone local issues.  If students all registered to vote in Davis, they could literally dominate the city counsel and make the city awesome for students.  But apathy reigns supreme.  Any thoughts? - ["JaimeRaba"]

''2004-11-29 05:33:58'' [[nbsp]] I think that students should participate more in local politics.  However, nearly all of the undergraduates in Davis will ["Stay In Davis" flee upon graduation].  Local politics affect them for only so long, whereas residents have to see the long-term affects of city matters.  I think that sometimes folks forget that Davis would be nothing without the ["Campus"] and the students in it. . - ["PhilipNeustrom"]

''2004-12-11 18:51:32'' [[nbsp]] Quite a few in Davis proper refer to this as the "Emptyprize." Locals usually get their regular news from the Sac Bee, and merely check the Enterprise for local politics, obituaries, and wedding announcements. Now, as to the discussion so far: without UCD Davis would be what it is fast becoming anyway: a bedroom community for Sac and the Bay Area, and highly unaffordable for most people, including recent graduates. - ["CentralDavisite"]

''2004-12-11 23:27:25'' [[nbsp]] Yeah, but the theatre reviews are terrific.  (in my purely unbiased opinion, of course) - ["BevSykes"]
