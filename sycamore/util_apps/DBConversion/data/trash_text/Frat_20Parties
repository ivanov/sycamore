What is a Frat party?  Well, it's a party that's put on by a ["Fraternities" Fraternity].  These parties are not to be confused with ["Bro Parties"], and are sometimes well orchestrated productions.  Lots of frat parties happen on ["Frat Row" Frat row].

Frat parties are usually the "type" of party you see in movies: dudes dancing on tables, tons of kegs, loud ghetto music.  The beer always sucks at frat parties so don't expect to get ["drunk"].
