I don't know anything about this group, but I followed the link, entered a made-up phrase in the text box, and downloaded the album.  I like it, especially ''ghost of christmas past''! My housemate actually came into my room to say, "holy shit, what are you playing?  It's fucking cool." - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
