Manna serves Korean and Japanese dishes, with good portion sizes and reasonable prices for a ["Downtown"] Davis meal.

I don't recommend the salmon.  It had lots of teeny little bones.  I've heard good things from some people about other things they sell though. - ["MarieHuynh"]

''The older dude that runs this place is really friendly. The ribs are good, the spicy food is truly ''spicy'', but I'd avoid the chicken dishes.'' -["coloursinmyhead"]
 * Why would you avoid the chicken dishes? - ["JackHaskel"]
 * I've had nothing but good luck with the chicken. Especially good (for the price) is the teriyaki chicken lunch special -- it's only $4 or so and is quite tasty! - ["KenNeville"]
