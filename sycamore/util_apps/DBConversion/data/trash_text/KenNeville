Hi.

I'm Ken Neville. Huzzah. I've worked at ["Ken's Bike & Ski"] for over two years. I've lived here since ["Valley Oak Elementary School" sixth grade] (minus a few years for school and such), so I like to think I know my way around this place pretty well. Hopefully I'll add some useful stuff to this wiki!

Uh, and for those of you who see my comments about my job, I'm not ''the'' Ken ... just in case you were wondering. I should probably indicate here that none of my personal commentary on this wiki in any way indicates the views of my employer.

Here is a small picture of me using my webcam as a shaving mirror. Glad you stopped by.

Ken would like the ["Ben & Jerry's"] flavor ''Chubby Hubby''. Because he likes peanut-butter-filled pretzels. - ["RobRoy"]
I have known this guy for like 10 years, he is a good guy to know in Davis cuz he's got it wired!  If you see him out and about give him a 'howzit bra' for me.  Ski your brains out his year! Aloha. - ["scotty nugs"]
