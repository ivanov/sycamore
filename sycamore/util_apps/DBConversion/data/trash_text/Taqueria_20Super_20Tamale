Many Davis residents have never heard of this Mexican restaurant.  They don't advertise other than the sign on their store front.  They aren't even in the phone book.  Many people who've been here think this is the most authentically Mexican restaurant in Davis.

They're pretty vegetarian-friendly, as they don't use lard or meat broth in their refried beans or rice.

The owner is a very friendly guy.  He calls many of his customers "amigo."  The other people who work there seem to be his family; they aren't as friendly.

They have varied menu options including breakfast selections (served from 8 am to 11:30 all six days), traditional a la carte items in addition to 25 combination platters, daily specials, children's plates, group meal options, some salads, and both Mexican and American beverages.  On Saturdays they specialize in Menudo and Posole, although this reviewer has yet to sample either dish.

They offer a small salsa bar; although the choice selection can't compare to larger restaurants such as ["El Mariachi"], the salsas are homemade and delicious.
