Crouched between ["Bainer Hall"] and ["Physics and Geology"], Roessler consists of two lecture halls on the bottom and a bunch of lab classrooms on the top. Practically all Physics 9-Series classes seem to be taught in the north-facing lecture hall (66, pictured), and the labs for said classes take place upstairs.

There is a tunnel between Roessler and PhysGeo.  Take the elevator on the southside to the basement to see for yourself.
