Garrett lives in  a ["Gay PD" house] full of beautiful women and also a beautiful chap who created this interactive site.  He plays solo, and often.  He also promotes live music all over the place (especially at ["Delta of Venus"]).  He sings in ["ChoadBot"], and secretly loves The ["Playboy Millionaires"] even though his alter-ego does not let him express this in public.  He wants you to listen to The ["Zim-Zims"], ["Legubitron"], ["Brilliant Red Lights"], ["Water For Free"], Antenas Erupt, Sholi, ["Butch Vs. Femme"], and any other local acts who are making this small town worth living in.
