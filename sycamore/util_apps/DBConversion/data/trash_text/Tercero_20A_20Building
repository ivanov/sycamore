Supposedly A building is haunted and they hold the "haunted house" for the dorms every year.  

It's also one of the buildings that is closest to the cows.

The story goes that there were twins, one at UCD in A building and one at UCSD.  The UCD girl woke up in the middle of the night and drew a picture of her sister on the overhang outside and above her window in pencil.  Then she went back to bed.  When she woke up the next day, her sister had killed herself at the exact moment that she had drawn the picture. ''Can someone get a photo? -- ["KenBloom"]''

Supposedly, people have tried to erase it, and it comes back, and people have tried to paint over it and it still comes back.
