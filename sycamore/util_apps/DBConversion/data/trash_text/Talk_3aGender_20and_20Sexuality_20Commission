  * ''["KenBloom"], I removed your addition to ["JenndelaVega"]'s comment because it is unnecessary.  If she says it, we can assume that it is just as factual as any other page in the wiki.  Adding the fact that it is her comment is unnecessary, and unethical.  Go read through the [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UnethicalEditing Unethical Editing] section mentioned in the ["Wiki Ethics"] page.  It's wrong  to add quotes or citations for anyone else's comment.  Please refrain from doing so in the future.'' - ["BrentLaabs"]
     * All wiki contributions are "signed" in the history.  I think making that attribution explicit is not a lie if it is accurate, because it merely restates what is in the history for an article.  Does it imply that the person meant to sign something?  Well, unlike wikipedia, there are no anonymous submissions.  Therefore, I think as long as the submittor's text is not altered in anyway or form, adding attribution is okay.  If this system supported anonymous contributions, then it might be different. -["JaimeRaba" jr]
      * I disagree. One should not add signatures to what other people have written unless it is obvious that they forgot to do it themselves. If the comment contains clear opinion such as "I think that..." then it's ok to add a signature but otherwise it isn't. People may want it unsigned, regardless whether it is marked in the page history as written by them. - ["JackHaskel"]
  * ''I completely agree with this case, however, it does create an interesting situation wherein notable people (elected officials, people who represent orgs) might make statements on the Wiki that are quotable within entries (either that entry or another).  If, on Wikipedia, Jimmy Carter (the actual ex-president) wrote either a piece or comment on current affairs, it could be quotable within the Jimmy Carter entry.  To my knowledge, there is no clear Wiki ethic for such use (quoting a Wiki update or entry by a person, with attribution, to another entry).  Obviously it doesn't happen that often when dealing with the scope of people that Wikipedia deals with, but it's quite likely that the situation could occur here.  ASUCD elected officials or even politicians from the city of Davis posting here is clearly likely.'' -- ["JabberWokky"]
 * The comment that "'Mason' allegedly videotaped the events for academicbias.org" is not a statement of fact. It's certainly not what "Mason" alleged he was doing. It's a statement of the Jenn de la Vega's opinion. As such, I added an attribution. -- ["KenBloom"] 
   * ''If some people say that Mason videotaped it for academicbias.org, then the statement "'Mason' allegedly videotaped the events for academicbias.org" is not only factual, it is the most fair wording possible.  If you feel he didn't, then put a counterpoint up.'' -- ["JabberWokky"]
 * [[s(start)]] On second thought, tomorrow I should just put that last comment on the ["GASC"] page, and then we can be done with this page. (For now I'm going to sleep).  -- ["KenBloom"] [[s(stop)]]
 * Thanks for the wiki ethics link. I didn't realize adding the attribution was considered unethical. I think I'm going to drop the issue over what the wiki says. Jenn de la Vega might try to summon me for disliking her commission again. I don't dislike her commission -- I just wanted to make sure the wiki was accurate. Since this is obviously a point of contention, I think I'll avoid getting more suspiciously involved in the dispute. -- ["KenBloom"]

 * I think much of the problem stems from the bolded 'with their permission' which is not entirely clear in the first place.  That's why Jen had to reply -- permission wasn't clear.  I think rephrasing the two paragraphs into one would be best?  After all, permission was given to film by the GASC officials, but the individual was being misleading as well -- he said he'd asked the panelists.  --["PhilipNeustrom"]
    * Okay, that is a problem.  I think I misunderstood the controversy.  But I am a fan of clarifying who's saying what, when that can be accomplished without any substantial change or distortion.  Obviously that's not what happened.  Gotcha. -["JaimeRaba" jr]
