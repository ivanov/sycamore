Also known as the Campus Salvage yard, this fenced off area always has at least two open entrances.  It is located south of the ["Bargain Barn"] and north of the lodge (which is at the ["Arboretum"]).  All metal, electronic related items, and anything that the campus at one point or another valued goes there as their last stop before being tossed.  This includes computers, monitors a-plenty (hence the name), books from the libraries (usually uninteresting things like surveys of groundwater from 1956), desks, VCRs, tape decks and other large equipment that does strange things and is for the most part - very broken.  There is often broken glass there and there are signs that warn of toxic contamination on site.  Much caution is emphasized strongly.

Here is an example of hardware that ends up at the monitor graveyard:

In Summer of 2004, two cameras were installed.  These are identical to a model that was installed in the Cuarto dorms (Specifically, the Emerson building although there may be other installations).  It is conjectured that there is no night vision or audio feed on these cameras.  However, it is unknown as to where they feed to and how closely monitored they are.  Their resolution, quality, and frame rate is also unknown.  However, police do frequent the site during the night and it is occupied on the weekdays from at least 4 am to 2 am daily and also often on the weekend at unpredictable hours.

In Fall of 2004, a new large fence with a concrete re-inforced base was installed around the main dumpster area on the site which includes the location of the monitors.  This was to replace a temporary fence that previously allowed easy access.  Shortly thereafter, the dumpsters which used to be easy to climb into, were replaced with taller, more secure dumpsters that were significantly more difficult to get into.
