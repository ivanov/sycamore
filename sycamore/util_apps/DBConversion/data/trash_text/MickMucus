Davis' version of a punk rock legend. His bands include Anal Mucus, ["Bottle of Violins"], Gift of Goats, the Magi-Kool Dudes and a few others.

He has hosted a show on ["KDVS"] for many years. He is on Tuesdays at nine pm.

Mick is also a ["Woodstock's Pizza"] delivery man. It is always recommended that you tip him well because he has many friends in this town with brass knuckels and criminal backgrounds.

He lives at the ["Charred Dog House"].
