Yet another burrito place in Davis -- this one is reputedly the oldest.  The food at Davis Taqueria is good -- the salsa is even better.  Check out their cabeza if you're daring... (it's beef brains!)

Their happy hour deal is among the best in Davis.  See ["Discounts and Freebies"] and ["Cheap Food"].  Every Thursday and Saturday from 8pm-9pm $1 tacos and $1 bottles of beer.  Brother and sister work together to run the place and both are extremely welcoming and kind people.  Prices are, however, more expensive than ["Guadalajara"].
