Sometime after receiving the generous grant for the ["Mondavi Center"] for the Performing Arts, UC Davis must have realized that there really isn't anything on the south side of campus. They likely came to the decision that some other things needed to be built on the land surrounding the future Mondavi Center, but didn't want to actually build anything themselves. So they got the idea to rent out the land to some developers to build a Hotel and Conference center, making use of a similar financial paradigm to that which runs ["The Colleges at La Rue"], a ["Tandem Properties" tandem property] on land owned by UCD.

That being said, east of the ["Mondavi Center"] sits an optimistic sign (next to its twin, which advertises the ["Graduate School of Management Building"]) showing some concept art of the Hotel and Conference Center that may at some future date lie east of the ["Buehler Alumni & Visitors Center"].

I think there's a ditch there right now, and some trees. They'll probably fill in the ditch and get rid of the trees before they build the hotel. I hope so.

The Hotel and Conference center has been discussed at length in UCD Faculty's circlejerk periodical, "Dateline UCDavis". Follow along with this edge-of-your-seat drama:

UC Davis Real Estate Services, the part of UCD that decides to rent out land to unsavory businesspersons, has a [http://www.ormp.ucdavis.edu/realestate/projects/hcc/index.html detailed page on the Hotel and Conference Center], which may contain actual facts.
