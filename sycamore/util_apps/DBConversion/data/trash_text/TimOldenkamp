Tim Oldenkamp - There are some who believe this man never existed.  Those who do believe in him do not speak his name fearing to bring down his wrath upon themselves.  


Many legends and epic tales speak of his greatness.  It is with awe and amazement that I don his name and make it my own.  I only pray that I will not disgrace such a glorious name.
