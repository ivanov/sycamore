''2005-01-05 15:44:33'' [[nbsp]] I think the last one is too beautiful to NOT use. --["GiladGurantz"]------
''2005-01-05 16:05:59'' [[nbsp]] The last one would get good TV ratings-- it's totally fear factor material.  But it will probably cost more votes than it gains.  The other ones are effective if not charming. --["JaimeRaba"]------
''2005-01-05 23:14:58'' [[nbsp]] My friend Carla says that the fluid in that mug is too dark, suggesting that either it isn't your urine or that you need to drink a lot more water. --["RevChad"]------
''2005-01-06 00:06:18'' [[nbsp]] You got my vote. Isn't it against the rules to 'campaign' before the official start though? --["JackHaskel"]------
''2005-01-06 10:30:02'' [[nbsp]] Actually SOSSS just won both of their complaints against the elections board in a recent SJA ruling. It is perfectly legit to campaign whenever, the elections board was just misleading people. --["DanMasiel"]------
''2005-01-06 22:18:49'' [[nbsp]] the drinking the urine reminds me of dodgeball --["RohiniJasavala"]

''2005-01-16 17:53:00'' [[nbsp]] Will Rob Roy stand up for free speech, specifically the right to use profanity, to be a part of the F.U.C.K. Platform? --["RobertBaron"]

''2005-01-16 23:49:59'' [[nbsp]] Well, what do you think, Mr. Baron?  If you can't figure it out on your own, suffice to say that I just added it to our official slate platform (which has gotten pretty huge lately). --["BrentLaabs"]
