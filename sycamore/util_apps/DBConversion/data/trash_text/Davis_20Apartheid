''The Davis Apartheid'' is a phrase used by a few to denote what they feel is: "the fact that this town is half college students and yet college students do not get any representation on the ["City Council"] and the ["Davis Police Department" police] specifically try to infringe on the social lives of college students." The movement encourages people to "["Boycott Davis"] due to the town's intolerance of University students. The intolerance is portrayed in the city's attitude toward [http://www.californiaaggie.com/article/?id=973 expanding housing for students] and its [http://www.city.davis.ca.us/meetings/councilpackets/20040727/04M_Large_Party_Response.pdf no-party policy] while not providing an outlet for students to do anything on the weekend." One theory is that if students do not spend money in Davis, and maybe even go as far as to tell friends that still attend high school in their home town to not apply to UC Davis because of the town's attitude toward students, then the city would inevitably feel an economic burden and realize its dependency on the student population and therefore begin to respect them as citizens of the community.

 * Imbalances in representation can be solved by ''proportional representation''.  For nonpartisan elections, ["Choice Voting" choice voting] is ideal.  See the [http://californiaaggie.com/article/?id=2822 Aggie letter to the editor] on this subject.  (Look at the letter towards the bottom.)

''2004-12-20 12:20:28'' [[nbsp]] And just how much attempt have students made to become involved with town politics, committees, activities, etc?  Is it the community's responsibility to represent the students' interests, or is it the students' responsibility? - ["BevSykes"]

''2004-12-20 13:15:02'' [[nbsp]] [http://www.californiaaggie.com/article/?id=4635 Aggie editorial]. Summary: Ex officio student council member is unnecessary. If students really wanted to be represented, they'd register to vote and run for office. Students could consistantly dominate the city government if they were so inclined. - ["ArlenAbraham"]

''2004-12-20 14:02:19'' [[nbsp]] This website itself was started by college students getting involved in the community. The activities of the "community" do not typically cater to college students. The community does whatever it can to be sure college students do not vote in city council elections. They hold them in the spring when it is less likely for younger people to vote. This town is a great town I just wish that it realized it is not just a suburb of Sacramento but it is is its own town because it is a "College Town." And it makes sense for Apartheid to go on in Davis since Davis is ["Ethnicity" ethnically] made up of [http://www.city-data.com/city/Davis-California.html %25 people of German and English heritage] - historically two very oppressive cultures. I guess it is just in this town's genes.  - ["RobRoy"]------
''2004-12-20 14:08:17'' [[nbsp]] Overall, I think Davis is a well run city. However, I feel the residents have a certain grudge against the university and its students (while loving it at the same time). Many permanent residents are unsensitive to the needs of additional student housing, university growth, and more student nightime activities downtown. - ["JamesDawe"]-----
''2004-12-20 14:32:42'' [[nbsp]] How about organized efforts to get students informed about city issues and likewise get residents informed of student issues?  Also, I think there needs to be clairity as to what exactly the issues are.  Is a major issue the lack of a accessible, cheap venue -- along with noise violations?  What is a possible solution to this?  I know that many on the ["ASUCD"] ["Senate"] (especially those in the ["Student Focus"] slate) promised to help establish such a venue -- but it fell through.  Also, I see from Arlen's article that there were "proposed meetings between two executive ASUCD officials and two councilmembers," but what ever happened with these? - ["PhilipNeustrom"]

''2004-12-20 20:18:40'' [[nbsp]] Four things: (A) Wow that Aggie article (about segregating students)  kicked Stan Forbes ass, (B) I'm disappointed in the lot of you for the low vote turnout for Lamar Heystek last election, though I think the persons involved in this Wiki are probably more likely to have voted than your average student, (C) vote for me when I run for City Council (=  (D) wow I am shocking and appalled at Robroy's racist slight at Germans and the English.  Though "my people" were cruelly oppressed by the English empire for 800 years I do NOT believe there is ANYTHING inherent in English genes (or German, or any other peoples) that make them more cruel and bloodthirsty than anyone else and really I can't ephasize enough how shocked and appalled I am that our own Robroy would make such a statement.  I am not being hyperbolic here: that is racism.  - ["KrisFricke"]------

''2004-12-20 23:45:44'' [[nbsp]] If you can't make fun of the English and Germans for their past blunders then who can you make fun of? I know its not PC but I was just making a joke. I'm Scottish, we're the original white trash people, so it wasn't really "racism." I was making fun of white people. I am allowed to. I am white. That is the rule of comedy. Everyone should step off their high horses. Maybe I just read too many history books; and seeing as it was the Germans and English that first embraced the idea of eugenics it was really a sarcastic and ironic statement. Read between the lines and don’t take everything I say one hundred percent seriously. We all know me don’t we. I’m the ["Ku Klux Klown"]. - ["RobRoy"]

''2004-12-21 20:53:14'' [[nbsp]] Bev, one example is the Davis Governance Task Force, which the council created to study the issue of ''representation'' in Davis government.  3 students applied for the 9 spots (plus one alternate).  There were 20 applicants.  There was a "student" check mark on the application.  No students were picked.  In fact, out of the [http://www.city.davis.ca.us/meetings/council/m09-21-04.pdf 49 votes cast] by the 5 councilmembers, only 2 were cast for students.  Moreover, applications were solicited over the summer. - ["ChrisJerdonek"]------
''2004-12-21 20:59:36'' [[nbsp]] Rob, the election date is only going to get worse.  The California legislature moved the spring primaries to early June, and council elections are held during the primary election. - ["ChrisJerdonek"]
------
''2004-12-21 21:25:35'' [[nbsp]] Apartheid seems like such a poor choice to words to describe the lack of student representation here in Davis. For the most part, as has already been pointed out, if the students cared enough, they could fix things, unlike in the South Africa of the past. It doesn't help anything to call it Apartheid, it only turns possible alies and friends into adversaries. - ["EricKlein"]------
''2004-12-22 10:21:15'' [[nbsp]] ChrisJerdonek: is there perhaps a way to make the city move their council elections to general elections? (better yet even-year general elections - ["KenBloom"]

''2004-12-22 12:55:23'' [[nbsp]] Ken, yes, the [http://leginfo.ca.gov/calaw.html CA Elections Codes] say [http://leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=elec&group=01001-02000&file=1300-1304 here] that a city council may pass an ordinance to move the date of city council elections to, for example, the statewide general election. This would be a good suggestion to bring up to the [http://www.ci.davis.ca.us/meetings/agenda.cfm?c=27 Davis Governance Task Force].  This is exactly the sort of thing they're looking at.  Their next meeting is tonight at 7PM at the city chambers.  - ["ChrisJerdonek"]
------
''2004-12-22 13:05:05'' [[nbsp]] If elected to the ASUCD senate, as I plan to run this winter, I will certainly publicize an effort to move the city council election to the first Tuesday of November every other even year - a day when people are more likely to vote. And I guess even if I am not elected then I will still try to do something to change the election date. We should all get together on this. Obviously, for students, this is a nonpartisan issue. - ["RobRoy"]------
''2004-12-22 20:46:24'' [[nbsp]] ChrisJerdonek: I'm in sunnyvale, home for break. You didn't happen to go and mention the idea? (Otherwise it will need to wait until after the break) - ["KenBloom"]------
''2004-12-24 17:45:55'' [[nbsp]] Consider this:  In [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene Eugene, OR] -- a college town with a liberal atmosphere -- police travel around on weekends, stop at houses with parties, and as soon as there is mild evidence of anyone drinking they enter the place.  They immediately tell everyone to freeze and not leave, and give breath tests/ID everyone there, handing out tons of Minor In Possession tickets ($250 a pop).
