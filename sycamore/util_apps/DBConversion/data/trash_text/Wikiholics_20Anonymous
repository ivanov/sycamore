=What does Wikiholics Anonymous mean to you?=

 * ''According to ["RobRoy"]:''  Wikiholics Anonymous is a fictional group of people that are able step away from the Wiki for longer than a day, without even thinking about the Wiki. Wiki Anonymous members lead average day to day lives. They hang out at coffee shops on occasion and only drink tea, but always tip three hundred percent. They enjoy walking purple puppy dogs on the moon. They never smoke cigarettes, drink any alcohol, or eat anything with citrus. They don't cast shadows except for at high noon. They type with all eleven fingers but only type six words a minute. They are illiterate. They hate circles so when they go to their meetings (and the average member goes to meetings at least seven times a day) they form rectangles, but sometimes they form squares. They place their hands in their neighbors rectum and say, "My name is (_ _ _ _) and I am a Wikiholic." Oh yeah, and all Wikiholics Anonymous members are to be shot on site upon entering the ["Davis" city of Davis].

 * ''According to ["DanMasiel"]:'' In one of the only just applications of the Patriot Act that I have ever seen, federal agents recently apprehended servel militants that are suspected of being members of the splinter group ["Martyrs of the Wikiholic Jihad"]. Appearantly they were driving an explosives laden ["Unitrans"] bus north on Anderson when they were stopped by police. The explosives were detonated causing blackouts throughout Davis, for most of the evening. No one was harmed as the bombers appearantly got cold feet about their suicide mission, fleeing the bus at the last possible moment. The ["Davis Police Department" DPD] released a statement describing the suspects as "a couple o' wussies from the UCD ["LiveJournal"] community." It is widely suspected that memebers of MWJ have infiltrated various other ["ASUCD"] related groups. And rumors are circulating wildly that up to half of the members of the ["Student Focus"] slate and even several members ["SOSSS"] are in fact agents of MWJ.
