Across from ["Bogey's Books"].  The plaza, which opened in 2000, is bordered by ["Baskin Robbins"], ["Thai Bistro"], ["The Avid Reader for Younger Readers" The Avid Reader Children's Book Store], and the ["Great Wall"].  

Includes a ["Downtown Stories" performing area] and benches for relaxing while you eat your ice cream or listen to the music on a summer night.

The ["Downtown Stories" performing area] is dedicated to [http://wheel.dcn.davis.ca.us/~basykes/paul.htm Paul Sykes], lead singer of ["The Band Lawsuit"] and manager of the ["Varsity Theatre"], (and son of ["BevSykes" Bev] and Walt Sykes), who died in 1999.

''2005-01-12 00:10:15'' [[nbsp]] Is the performing area open to anybody to use?  Walking past it, I had wondered if Bev was connected to the memorial plaque (I had thought it was a father or other older relative). --["JabberWokky"]------
