The [http://www.payphone-project.com/ Payphone Project] was a web site started by a man in the late 1990s. Through the collabarative powers of the Internet, hundreds of thousands of numbers have been listed on the site, from payphones all over the world. This idea is incredible, but there are many flaws with the site-- static HTML is employed to list the numbers, meaning someone will have to go in by hand to update each one of them; numbers have brief or vague desriptions of their locations and are often inaccurate; updating false information is also more difficult because of the site's static design. 

With the Davis Payphone Project, we intend to take this idea one step further by creating a dynamic wiki-fueled database of Payphones in Davis, California. Not only will each listing include the number of the phone, but at least one photograph of the phone and hopefully a description of the surroundings as well as any stories that involve the specific phone. Thanks to the incredibly flexible technology of Wiki, compiling such a comprehensive list should prove much simpler and more involving than the original Payphone Project's design. This project will be able to seamlessly integrate with the Davis Wiki to enable users access to information on payphones surrounding each node on the Davis Wiki.
