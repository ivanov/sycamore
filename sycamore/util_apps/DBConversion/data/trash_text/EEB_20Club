EEB stands for ["Evolution, Ecology, and Biodiversity"]. This community service club is spanking new. It is open to anyone interested in learning more about ecology and getting involved with ecological issues. The club's main focus this year will be a ["Greenhouse Project"] for the [http://www.saczoo.com/ Sacramento Zoo] (the club is going to design and create it). 

Since the club is just starting out, any and all suggestions about the direction the club should go in or how to fulfill the current objective are more than welcome:)
