Hunan is the finest [Americanized] Chinese food restaurant in Davis. PLUS IT HAS A ["Bars" BAR]! The food is always orgasmic and their prices are competitive. Their happy luncheon offers very generous portions of the entrée you order and also includes chow mein, your choice of steamed or fried rice, and soup or salad. The soup changes from day to day. Most of the lunch items range from between 4.50-5.00.  The lunch environment is somewhat informal. Almost any given day you will find a large group of college students around one of the larger round tables laughing and having a good time. The dinner environment is much more formal and quiet. Prices for dinner are more expensive but servings are much larger. Almost all Soups, Tofu, Vegetables, and Appetizers cost 4.00-6.00. Pork, Beef, and Chicken entrées typically run between 7.00-8.00 and Seafood dishes average between 8.50-11.50. If you don't want to eat there you can also place an order to go and get 10% off.

''["SarahHillard"] and I went there for dinner Jan 2005, and were very very underwhelmed.  Our Calimari was excellent, although it came with a pretty generic soy sauce.  She ordered lemon chicken that was limp and not very lemony.  I had the spicy crispy duck that managed to be dry, a fairly difficult thing to do for duck.  All the food came out very late, something that they explained (after bringing out the food) was due to their burning the first duck.  Despite spending $30 on dinner, there was no soup or other minor side things that normally go along with ordering two entrees.  I got a plate of duck (no sauce), and she got chicken.  We had to ask for rice.  Lunch may well be better, but I'll not likely go again for dinner.  Recommended for lemon chicken is ["Noodle Express"].'' -- ["JabberWokky"]
