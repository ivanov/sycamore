Procrastinating can be a fine art form, and it's not just for students!  Nearly anyone can procrastinate on nearly anything!  Bills, reading, homework, [[s(begin)]]feeding your children[[s(end)]]. .

"Study breaks", "computer breaks", "music breaks", "anything-under-the-sun breaks" -- these are just synonyms for ''not doing what you're supposed to be doing''.

Procrastination can often be turned into [http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~john/procrastination.html Structured Procrastination] -- the process in which a ton of work ''unrelated to'' what you're ''supposed'' to be doing gets done.  Davis Wiki is a great form of structured procrastination, and was largely formed (even the development) out of a need to waste time on something unrelated to what everyone was supposed to be doing.  A key except from John Perry's [http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~john/procrastination.html excellent essay] on the topic:

    Procrastinators often follow exactly the wrong tack. They try to minimize their commitments, assuming that if they have only a few things to do, they will quit procrastinating and get them done. But this goes contrary to the basic nature of the procrastinator and destroys his most important source of motivation. The few tasks on his list will be by definition the most important, and the only way to avoid doing them will be to do nothing. This is a way to become a couch potato, not an effective human being.

Procrastination is the common religion that brings us all together.
