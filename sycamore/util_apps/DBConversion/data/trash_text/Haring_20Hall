Located in the space between ["Hutchison Hall"] and ["The Silo"] that would otherwise be an open, gaping maw, Haring Hall is a strange and mystical place for Veterinary students. It also houses ["Haring 2205"], a very large lecture hall where masses of lower-divison undergraduates can take their 16 series math classes or whatever those kids are doing these days.
