=== Meetings ===
The ASUCD Gender and Sexuality Commission (GASC) meets every Tuesday from 4:30pm to 6:30pm in the Moss room on the 3rd floor of the ["Memorial Union"] (during the academic year). They are fun, so you should go there and help them plan programs which will help or interest you. GASC is also a good reason to say "sex" a lot.

Note worthy visitors to GASC meetings include members of ["Senate" Student Senate], ["George Andrews"], and many members of ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"] such as GASC supporters ["RobRoy" Rob Roy] and ["RevChad" Rev. Chad Van Schoelandt].

Occassionally people mention personal examples when discussing programs, including their own sex toy use.

"See you at the next meeting!" - ["RevChad"]

=== Critiques of this Commission ===
Every year GASC's "Sex Toy Workshop" causes controversy.
  * In 2004, Ian Watson wrote an [http://www.californiaaggie.com/article/?id=6675 opinion in the aggie] about why he thinks the workshop is "[an] idea so bad [it is] almost humorous." 
    * He based his opinion on what little he saw as he "poked [his] head in for a while".  Had he stayed for the entire workshop, he would have learned that since butt plugs should always have a wide stopper to keep it from going too far in, he should have put something around his neck to keep his head from getting wedged so far up his ass. --["MarieHuynh"] paraphrasing ["RevChad"]
  * ["The California Aggie"] (print edition) contained an article on 1/12/2005 talking about an alleged liberal named "Mason" filming Generation Sex Week events '''with their permission''' -- which are so-called 'Safe Zones' in which individuals are encouraged to speak freely.  GASC suspected the filming individual to be a conservative because of his persistence.
    * It is true that the individual known as "Mason" received permission from commissioners to film interviews, but he was misleading in the regard that he told commissioners that he was filming from a "liberal website" and was getting footage of "activism on campus".  He was clearly not what he said himself to be after leaving several incriminating paper program evaluations stating it was a "waste of student money". He also did not receive full permission from the Sexuality panel participants or the participants of the open mic night. "Mason" allegedly videotaped the events for http://academicbias.com
  * "The critiques I have read basically take the approach of "This shouldn't be done, so this shouldn't be talked about."  As opposed to the approach "Since this is done, we should talk about it".  The former is the same logic that the DARE program uses - which is why they don't talk about actually doing drugs, just that you ought not to do them.  The consequences of actually doing them are not discussed.  Similarly, conservatives don't like AIDS awareness or homosexual discussion in general, because once again, they think people ought not be doing them so it would be best not to talk about them.  Any logical person that isn't bent up on emotional prejudices can see just where this approach would lead to - and it's not down a bright and cheery path.  Call me a liberal, but anyone that criticizes events like the ones that GASC put on are just playing a game with themselfs of denying reality." - ["ChristopherMcKenzie" cjm]
   * Exactly.  I've heard people say it is a liberal event while it is aimed at education without politics being involved at all.  I think the people who focus on GASC using student fees should see where else their student fees go to.  Places like the Health Center that give educational sessions on birth control are funded with student fees.  Places like the Womens' Center, the LGBTRC, and more are all funded, in part, by student fees.  These places all have a goal of educating and improving the physical, mental, social, and sexual health of the students - not some liberal agenda. - ["RohiniJasavala" Ro]
     * I can understand the "against" point of view; the Health Center and Womens' Center are focused on health, safety and support.  This is pretty much focused on "how to have kinky sex".  That said, I support it... but because I support education and discussion of anything to adults.  This seems to draw a crowd and is thus in demand... so was the Pixies concert last year.  That all said, if I *didn't* think it was appropriate for adults to be educated on and discuss kinky sex, I would be upset about it.  I think it's a healthy edge... there will be "edge" activities that some people don't want, and "over the edge" activities that the majority of people don't want.  I could probably find a group of people willing to lecture on zooaphilia, but I think that would be "over the edge".  Thus the line is drawn... when the majority of people involved want it gone, rather than a single person or minority. -- ["JabberWokky" jw]
 * [http://californiaaggie.com/article/?id=6993 Rob Roy wrote a letter on the topic of GASC that was published in the Aggie on January 18, 2005]
