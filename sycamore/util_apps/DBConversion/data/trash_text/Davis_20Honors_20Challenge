The Davis Honors Challenge (DHC) is a campus-wide honors program for 'motivated' students who want more challenging course work. 

Why do we even have this? Isnt college for motivated students pursing a challenging, dynamic education? Isnt college supposed to prepare you for the challenges in your professional and business career? Here is another thing you can join to get a pretty marking on your transcript:) and all you need to do is this:

 *First-Year Students take two honors challenge sections or honors courses, and one honors seminar.

 *Second-Year Students have the option of taking two honors challenge sections or honors courses, and one honors seminar, OR one honors challenge section or honors course, one honors contract, and one honors seminar.

 *Third-Year Students must complete two honors contracts and a third-year honors seminar.

 *Fourth-Year Students must complete a year-long project.


DHC students enjoy several special perks simply for being in the program.

 *They may checkout books from the library for 3 months instead of 2 weeks as if they were grad students (you need to tell them when you get your library account)

 *They may use the special DHC computer lab (which is mostly Macintoshes) in Kerr hall - there's also a fax machine and a copier

 *They have their own counselors who will work through university beaurocracy on their behalf if they have a problem

 *They used to be automatically accepted into ["The Colleges at La Rue" The Colleges] but don't anymore

 *They tend to get their GPA padded a bit as the special DHC-only sections and seminars usually give easy grades for the added units

 *They may apply to live in ["Nova Hall" Nova Hall] exclusively with other DHC students.

Many ["Integrated Studies" Integrated Studies] students transfer into the DHC after their first year.
