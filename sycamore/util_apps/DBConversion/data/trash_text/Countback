As of now, when somebody resigns or otherwise terminates their ["ASUCD"] ["Senate"] position they are replaced by an appointee chosen by the ["ASUCD President"].  In the period from the Winter of the 04' school year to the Winter of the 05' year there have been (["Senator Ackerman Scandal" Ackerman], ["Adam Barr" Barr] ["Sean Ruel" Ruel], ["Nafeh Malik" Malik]) 4 resignations.  So this means ["Kalen Gallagher"] got to choose 4 voting, acting members of the ["Senate"].  The current system gives the ["ASUCD President"] unprecedented authority.

A solution:  '''Countback'''.

Using the data from the previous election, the resigned/terminated candidate is 'eliminated' from the voting pool.  Then the election is conducted with the ballots that caused the eliminated candidate to win (the ballots that gave the candidate the winning threshold) along with the ballots that did not elect a candidate.  These are the ballots that have  no representation.  Whoever wins is given a seat on the ["Senate"].  Because we use  ["Choice Voting"] for our ["ASUCD Election" ASUCD Elections], the person who wins is most likely to represent the voting population who voted for the resigning candidate.

The city of Cambridge, MA uses the countback process to fill their choice voting vacancies.

== Malik and Ruel's resignations? ==

The 1026 ballots that went to elect Malik and Ruel, together with the 485 exhausted ballots, would have elected replacements Parisa Manteghi and Christina Chin, both Student Focus candidates.  Nafeh Malik and Sean Ruel were Student Focus Senators.  Here is the countback tally:

== Barr's resignation? == 

["Adam Barr"], once a member of the ["L.E.A.D."] ["Slate" slate], resigned from ["Senate"].  His appointed replacement, ["Cari Ham"], is a member of the ["Student Focus"] ["Slate" slate].  If countback were being used ["Cari Ham" Ham] would have been the ''first'' to be eliminated (meaning students who had voted for Barr would rather have ANY OTHER candidate than Ham replace him) and ["JenndelaVega" Jenn de la Vega] (who ran on ["L.E.A.D."]) would have been offered the position.

== Ackerman's resignation? ==

The 350 ballots that went to elect James Ackerman in Fall 2003, along with the 327 exhausted ballots, would have elected replacement Leticia Miller.  Ackerman was a Student Focus senator, and Miller was a Student Focus candidate.  Here is the tally, courtesy of DCR:

''This is a pretend countback where we assume 6 people ran for ["Senate"] and we are counting back to elect a replacement for senator C.  Here's our pile of ballots'':

Each pile is the collection of ballots that cause the winning candidates to get their threshold (''and win!'').  We then consider only the pile for Senator C and the unrepresented ballots (that did not push anyone past a winning threshold).  Then we run the election using those ballots, eliminating the resigning senator.  This is a more representitive system because the people without representation are asked to elect the replacement for their candidate.

''2005-01-28 01:11:54'' [[nbsp]] I like this idea...someone really needs to spearhead this and get it introduced into senate --["MattJojola"]------
''2005-01-28 01:24:37'' [[nbsp]] I believe someone is already on it, but they cant introduce it until the end of the quarter --["PaulAmnuaypayoat"]

''2005-01-28 16:08:13'' [[nbsp]] ["Jonathon Leathers"] has been working on it for a while. --["RevChad"]------
''2005-01-28 16:10:26'' [[nbsp]] haha. Davis Citizens for Representation has the same acronym as DCR --["MattJojola"]

''2005-01-29 00:30:28'' [[nbsp]] Huge problem: Not everyone (or even every ["JenndelaVega" Jenn De La Vega]) is eager to take on the role of senator months after an election has passed. And if people are given the offer to reject an appointment when they're counted-back, the system could just keep bubbling down the list until it got to some candidate that ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness" ran on a lark]. Under the current system where people have to APPLY for a vacant senator position, you know that at the very least every candidate for the job is at least ready to take it on at the time. --["TravisGrathwell"]

''2005-01-29 03:47:57'' [[nbsp]] Travis, I understand your concerns, but honestly, the current system of presidential appointments has to change because there is absolutley no garuntee that the Pres will choose an appropriate person to fill a vacancy. At least with countback, you take into account what the voters preferences were. --["PaulAmnuaypayoat"]------
''2005-01-29 12:19:33'' [[nbsp]] Travis, is this really a realistic worry?  Don't you think most people given the opportunity would jump at the chance to be Senator?  They did run after all -- knowing it's a year-long commitment.  There would have been 3 potential LEAD candidates in line to replace Adam in a countback.  And many more legitimate candidates after that. --["ChrisJerdonek"]
------
''2005-01-30 19:48:36'' [[nbsp]] I would have turned down the offer for a senate seat..I have other responsibilities now.  You shouldn't eliminate the possibility of someone not wanting to be a senator after the election, months even! Where do you draw the line for "do not hire" candidates when you countback? --["JenndelaVega"]------
''2005-01-30 22:34:58'' [[nbsp]] It's okay for someone not wanting to be Senator later on.   --["ChrisJerdonek"]------
''2005-01-30 22:51:41'' [[nbsp]] Say Jenn doesn't want to take a seat.  First: run the simulation assuming Jenn will not accept the seat.  Second: is there a limit on the number of candidates who reject the seat before the election data essentially becomes useless?  Should we set one? --["BrentLaabs"]------
''2005-01-31 00:06:49'' [[nbsp]] Brent, no there shouldnt. Example: we have a race with 1 open seat and 10 candidates, with the first 9 candidates dropping out. We cannot penalize the 1 remaining candidate and make him compete with 9 other people, he should win. Same thing in countback, its the only fair way to do it as far as I know. --["PaulAmnuaypayoat"]------
''2005-01-31 21:23:41'' [[nbsp]] I'm going to add language to the Countback Amendment so that if the first 5 people chosen to be a Replacement Senator decide not to serve, then it reverts back to a Presidential appointment with confirmation from the Senate. I will work on getting my platform and this amendment on the Wikik ASAP. --["JonathonLeathers"]------
''2005-01-31 23:30:34'' [[nbsp]] i think thats a great idea, even though it would mean that i wouldnt be a senator now. if you need help getting this bill moving, come and talk to me and we can make this happen --["AdamGerber"]
