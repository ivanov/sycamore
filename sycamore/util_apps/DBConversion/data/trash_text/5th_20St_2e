5th Street runs East/West and it turns into ["Russell" Russell Blvd.] when it crosses B street.  It stretches from ["Downtown"] to ["East Davis"], where it terminates at Alhambra Dr.

5th St. and Russel Blvd. combine to make the most important east-west thoroughfare in Davis.  

Notable Locations along 5th Street from West to East include:

== Landmarks ==
  * ["Central Park"]

== Major Intersections ==
  * ["F St."]
  * ["Pole Line Rd."]

== Restaurants and Shopping ==
  * ["Dairy Queen"]
  * ["Downtown"]
  * ["Hibbert Lumber"]
  * ["Hoffman 76"]
  * ["Konditorei"]
  * ["Pizza Guys"]
  * ["Taqueria Davis"]

== Services ==
  * ["Calgene Inc."]
  * ["Davis Police Department"]
  * ["DMV"]
  * ["Downtown Fire Station"] the main station for the ["Fire Department"]
  * ["Post Office"]
  * ["USDA"]

The section that runs from L Street to B Street is not good for bicycles. It appears that turn signals are being installed (1/29/2005) at the intersections with F and G. Traveling eastbound at L the left hand lane is a left turn only lane.
 * I prefer using 8th St. when biking in that stretch.
