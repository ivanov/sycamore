One of Davis' ["Town Characters"]. Two-step is a homeless man who hangs around south davis by the south davis taco bell.  More well known in the ["Davis Joint Unified School District" local Davis schools] than at UCD.  Nicknamed Two-step because, well, when he walks he generally takes two steps forward and one step back.  ( will try to get a picture.)  No one has ever heard him speak (if you have please please tell us of your experiences) and we dont know his real story.  (will get around to asking him one of these days.)

             * note : sometimes instead of taking the second step forward he will do a little shuffle, but you do not want to be wating for him to cross a street, trust me.
