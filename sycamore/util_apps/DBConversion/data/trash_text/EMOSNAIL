E.M.O.S.N.A.I.L., also known as the [http://www.livejournal.com/users/emosnail/ Echidna Media Organization's S.N.A.I.L. Project], is perhaps one of the best ways to find out about ["ASUCD"] news, particularly pertaining to the ["ASUCD Court"] and the ["Senate"].  It offers a relatively non-biased opinion of what is going on in ["Campus"] politics, considering how biased most people in ASUCD actually are.

The EMOSNAIL livejournal has also had the great distinction of being used as evidence against one of its many writers.  ["KrisFricke" Kris Fricke] may or may not endorse the opinions generated on the journal.

It usually has a picture of the day, which is a great source of photos of interesting moments in campus life.  As you can see from the photos, Miss ["KristyHeidenberger" KritsyHeidenberger] has unequalled beauty.
