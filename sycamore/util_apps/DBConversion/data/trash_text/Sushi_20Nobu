This is a great alternative when you can't stand waiting in the long lines for the lunchtime sushi buffet at ["Fuji Chef" Fuji]. Nobu's buffet is from 11am-2pm Monday-Saturday for $9. When it's busy, they'll come around with plates of sushi like a dim sum place; when it's quiet, you can order from their buffet menu directly from the sushi chef. There's also tempura, chicken katsu, edamame and noodles if you get tired of eating only sushi.
