Cafe Mediterranee is a pleasant Middle-Eastern eatery that has more of a "restaurant" feel than Sam's or Ali Babba.  However, their prices are much higher.  But for those higher prices, they throw in a couple of sides, which makes this actually a decent value.  Their rotissery chicken is quite good, and their babaganoush is perhaps the best in town.
