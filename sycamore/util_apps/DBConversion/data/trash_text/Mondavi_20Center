If you are student and interested in any of the shows there, ''all'' students (no matter what school you attend) get an amazing 50% discount. The performances can still be a bit pricey, but worth it for acts that might otherwise be completely unaffordable.
 
There are also a number of free shows at the center sponsored by various campus departments.
