Meyer Hall rests on the southern edge of campus along La Rue Rd.

The building has gigantic white canopies that soar above its courtyard. As such the building resembles some sort of pirate ship. Arg!

Meyer and ["Hart Hall"] both have media labs where you can find a bunch macs, scanners (flatbed), and negative/slide film scanners.  If you want to scan negatives you'll need to ask for the strip film holder.
