''This is what the coffee/cash area of Campus Roma looks like as of 09-01-04.''

This is what it used to look like, in a badly-taken photo (this was during early summer of 04):[[BR]]

The full name of the café is Espresso Roma Café.  

There are two Café Romas in Davis.

The Roma downtown is sometimes refered to as "Espresso Roma," while the Roma by campus is simply "Café Roma."  These names are incorrect but widely used.  "Campus Roma" and "["Downtown"] Roma" are more effective should be adopted as replacement terms.

Both Romas are patronized mainly by students in need of a cozy place to study.  There are often shows at the Romas: local bands often play, folks gather to do poetry readings, and there was (at least during the school year) weekly stand-up comedy.  The motto for Roma, as printed on the cups, is "Liquid culture."

The Romas are unique among the coffee shops in Davis because they provide a laid-back atmosphere, good music, and great coffee (get ["DinaDobkin" Dina] or Dan to make it!) without being pretentious.

Both Romas accept only cash, but the one by campus has an ATM if you forget cash.  They also both, of course, feature ["WiFi Hot Spots" wireless internet].

||Campus Roma also has full-length windows as walls, and the light pours into the place beautifully.||attachment:campusromawindows.jpg||

The mochas are good, but last I tried, the smoothie wasn't very....
  * They are practically ''never'' asked to make smoothies, so they usually aren't very good.
