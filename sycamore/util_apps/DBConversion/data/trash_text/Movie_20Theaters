''Admission chart forthcoming''

Both theaters run a ["$4 Movie Tuesday"]. The Holiday Cinema on F street is older, has six screens and more 'traditional' seats. Stadium 5 on G street has 'stadium' style seating (and smaller theaters and screens). Stadium 5 also has pretty good sound in all its theaters. ''(Holiday might have two screens with better sound than the other four, not sure)'' Keep an eye on the Stadium 5 listings for independent films. 

  Both ["Movies" movie] theaters in Davis are now owned by the [http://www.regmovies.com Regal Entertainment Group]. This means you can finally pay for your ["Movies" movie] and popcorn with a credit card and prices will probably continue to go up. - ["KenNeville"]

You might also be able to catch an inexpensive film via ["Campus Cinema"].
