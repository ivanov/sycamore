Busses whirl by, taking students to and from ["Campus"] as you chat away.  Perfect for impromptu phone calls and late-night rendezvous.  Also, if you're a super-hero, this is the perfect phone booth to change into your costume in.[[BR]][[BR]]'''Charge:''' 50 cents for local calls.[[BR]][[BR]] One time I was out of cell-phone battery and I used this phone to call a friend.  Once you're inside it (with the door closed) you feel like you're in a British spy movie.  I love the rough feel of the telephone booth and how heavy the metal door is. - ["PhilipNeustrom"][[BR]][[BR]]Summer Advisors used to (and perhaps still do) use this phone booth as a lame icebreaker by egging the Freshmen into stuffing as many of themselves into it as they can simultaneously. - ["TravisGrathwell"]||
