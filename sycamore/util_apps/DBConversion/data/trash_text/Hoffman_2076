Local franchise of Union 76 Gas, owned by Rick Hoffman.  It's not the cheapest gas in town, but the station has a good reputation and it's one of the few places in the area where you can still get full service.  You can sit back in your driver's seat, relax, and either fantasize it's still 1955 or that you live in Oregon or New Jersey.  Unfortunately, the employees don't wear caps or bowties, so be sure to close your eyes while you fantasize. 

Be sure to be nice to whoever pumps your gas; along with the usual high school kids gaining work experience, the underemployed, and those who just enjoy working at a filling station, there are others for whom this is just a way station in life, and you might meet them later when it counts...
