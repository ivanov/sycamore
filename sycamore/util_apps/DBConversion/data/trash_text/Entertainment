 * ''This may well duplicate another page I have yet to find, but several things like theaters are orphaned.  Plus this page just "feels right".  When/if a category gets too large, it should be split to its own page (like Music Scene is currently.  Consider that there is a "Night Time" and "Wish List", but not general "Entertainment" category on the home page.  Comments?'' -- ["JabberWokky" jw]
 * ''Seconded.  I like this page. --["ChrisTakemura" ct]
 * Nice, clean look. --["JamesDawe" jd]
 * I like it.  I think a good look for the Front Page categorization would something like the Yahoo setup, where you have the "major" category clickable, but there are several notable minor categories listed underneath.  The reason this is useful is because sometimes people won't get excited about entertainment, while they might get excited about say, "Night Time" or "Bands"..  You kind of get desensitized to bland major categories if there's not some exemplary minor catogories listed underneath.. --["JaimeRaba" jr]
