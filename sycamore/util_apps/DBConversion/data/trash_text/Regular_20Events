      * '''Rueda Dance Lesson''' 3PM-4PM @ Sierra2 Center (2791 24th Street, Sacramento - south of Broadway ).  Learn to dance "square dance style" salsa to Cuban timba music! Basically, a caller calls out each salsa pattern which the entire circle of dancers performs in unison to the music... partners are passed as in square dancing but it's all done to a great salsa beat with turns, spins, & a bit of flash, just like in regular salsa. You must have a grasp of basic salsa moves, but this is a great way to meet other salseros and improve your ear and footwork. The classes are $6 for drop-ins, or $20 if you want to commit to a four-week session; each lesson introduces a few new dance patterns. For more information call Fahad at (916) 802-4870.
