''Hoopie'' is an attempt to create a term for Davis' own flavor of hippy.  Many so-called ["Hippies"] residing in Davis are productive members of ["UC Davis" The Machine] and thus the term ''Hippie'' seems both offensive and lacking.  ''Hoopie'' originates from the fact that many so-called Hoopies live in the ["Cooperative Housing" housing co-operatives] Davis is known for (C''oop''s). Though their numbers have been in decline since the mid 1970s, restoration efforts are leading to slow but noticeable increases in the local population. Those wishing to observe one of the rare Davis Hoopies should begin their search at one of the following locations:

  * ["The Co-Op"] - The Davis Food Co-Op.
  * ["Cooperative Housing"] - Many, Many Co-Op Houses in Davis.
  * ["Delta of Venus"] - Coffee shop, deli, and live music.
  * ["Whole Earth Festival"]
