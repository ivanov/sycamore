The Davis Community Network, also known as [http://www2.dcn.org/ DCN], uses Internet resources to build local and regional community. It was founded in 1994 as the area's first non-university Internet access provider. Today, it provides web, e-mail list and calendar resources to hundreds of local organizations, and maintains an extensive directory of local web resources.

DCN also has an ''amazing'' [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet news] server, with retention and completion that most people would have to pay dedicated news providers for.
