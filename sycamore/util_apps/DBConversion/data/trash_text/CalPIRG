CalPIRG is the California Public Interest Research Group.

You'll often find them on campus asking you to pledge $5 to them.  That $5 pledge that you make is deducted from your student account every quarter, not just once.  At least you get a bright orange sticker that says, "I pledged CALPIRG".

They are a grassroots public interest group that lobbies for issues relevant to the general public.  One of the causes that they are involved with is lowering the high cost of textbooks for students.
