This is a recipie that asian families pass around amongst themselves.  All you need is yeast and a pound or so of cooked, sticky rice.  You can add however much sugar if you want.  Basically, you spread the cooked rice out on a pan and dust the yeast all over it.  Mix it up and make some golf ball sized balls.  Find a large bowl and line the inside of the bowl with the balls.  Dump some water in.  Cover and hide it in the closet.  Forget about it for about two weeks.  You can strain and drink if you want, but this is somewhat of a dessert thing so most people dump sugar in and eat the rice too.

If that works out well, try other kinds of rice.

This stuff is sold at chinese/vietnamese supermarkets so you can try to find it there.  They're often sold as 2-3 whitish balls floating in liquid in a cup.  Sometimes you'll see it in a jar, but those can get somewhat nasty.  Go for the fresh ones in a cup.  If there isn't enough alcohol content in it for you, let it sit in your fridge for a while.
