Sleeping on campus is a delicate art.  While anyone can sleep at home, it's not always the most convenient option.
Note that it is illegal to sleep on campus.  Make sure you don't get caught.  Three ["Davis Police Department" Popo] cars will surround you and tell you not to get caught again.

== During the day ==
 * If it's not too hot out, or too muddy, then sleeping in ["The Quad" the Quad] is a good choice.  A ton of people sleep in ["The Quad" the Quad].
 * ["Griffin Lounge"] is also a favorite spot.  It's always nice and cool, and perfectly quiet.  There's also lots of comfortable chairs.
 * ["King Lounge"] is pretty good.  There is a little more noise than ["Griffin Lounge"], but there is this padded bench thing that is pure heaven.
 * ["Shields Library"] has a few good spots.  In non-fiction, to the right side, there's usually nice cushions to sleep on.  Also, the "window seats" toward the center of each floor provide a lot of lie-down room and make for a cozy spot, provided the sun isn't shining in your direction.
 * ["Women's Center"] has cushy chairs, and nice people who won't stick things in your nose while you sleep there.  Usually filled with mostly women.
 * ["Unitrans"] is nice, especially a certain older bus that doesn't really have "seats" per se, more like a soft cushiony bench that just screams, "LIE ON ME!!!"  If you have time to kill, and like sleeping in the car, and like being warm on the bus, you can sleep here.
 * ["Kemper Hall"] has many couches in the lobby.  There is one that is between the computer museum and the large front window.  It is the perfect size to lay down on. This one is preferable, but all of them are fair game.
 * In class. OK, It's actually kind of uncomfortable, but sometimes class puts you to sleep. Only do this if you're getting an A in the class anyway.
== During the night ==
During the night you'll need to have snuck into a building that doesn't care you're inside (most have janitors that will kick you out).

  * ["24 Hour Reading Room"].  As long as you look like you were studying before you passed out (i.e. you don't have a blanket and pillow) they won't kick you out.

  * Grass someplace is a safe bet as no one is likely to bother you, but you'll have watch out for sprinklers and animal crap... Really, sleeping in the grass at night is a bad idea.

  * The ["Physics and Geology"] building has a really nice roof.  But that's not all!  They also have a couch up there (at least as of 08-06-04) on the roof that you can sleep in and stare at the stars!  Talk about '''nice'''!  Also, this is likely a good place to take someone if you want to make out with them, maybe.
     * I wasn't able to find this. Is this the floor marked "R" above the 5th floor with all manner of telescopes and stuff? That door was locked. Or was it the terrace thing outside the double-doors on the fourth floor? That was locked too. Or something else? -- ["RaghavKrishnapriyan"]
       * The roof.  The door to the roof is sometimes locked (but usually isn't).  There are a number of instruments and telescopes up there, but it's clearly the roof.  The picture on ["Physics and Geology"] at the bottom was taken from there. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
  * If you want to sleep in PhysGeo, the best place is the lobby on the fourth floor.  It it on the north end of the east side of the hallway, about 2 doors down. - ["ChristopherMcKenzie"]
