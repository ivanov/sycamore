=History=
Rocking the airwaves since 1967, '''KDVS 90.3 FM''' is one of four remaining full-time freeform community radio stations in the United States (others include WFMU in New Jersey, WESU in Connecticut, and WZRD in Chicago), and of those four, KDVS is the most powerful at 9200 watts.  Its signal is strong enough to reach from parts of the North SF Bay Area to the crest of the northern Sierra Nevada.

Licensed by the FCC to provide non-commercial, educational broadcasting to the Yolo, northern Solano, and Sacramento County community, KDVS plays everything from punk to jazz to rare psych/garage-rock to music of Middle Eastern folk traditions and experimental and as-yet-unclassified music of yet-to-be-named-genres; weekday programming also features no less than 2.5 hours of news and public affairs such as political talk shows, Free Speech Radio News, and Michael Mercury's astrology hour.  To find out what's playing on KDVS right now, check the [http://www.asucd.ucdavis.edu/radio/schedule.cfm complete schedule of shows].

"Freeform radio" is a boundless format wherein variety is a constant; furthermore, freeform radio principles strictly insist that full creative programming control be given to hosts and DJ's.  No program director or station brass may interfere with the music choices selected by each DJ.  That KDVS's playlists primarily feature obscure, underground, and independent music artists and bands is a result of unified adherence to a mission statement that values the station's role as a true alternative: KDVS exists to provide music and public affairs which listeners cannot get anywhere else in the local community.  If mainstream media only exposes one percent of all new music, KDVS's job will be to expose as much of the remaining 99% as possible.

The freedom of the freeform radio format is often used by KDVS DJ's to build bridges within the listening community.  Eclectic programs expose music from various (often disparate) cultures and subcultures, blended in a logical manner which shows the listener the links and similarities between these diverse expressions, and thereby adding educational value.

Most radio listeners require a great deal of predictability, but freeform radio has carved out a niche--to satisfy those individuals who demand more variety and prefer to seek out what is new or has been overlooked.  But, as you might guess, upon tuning in you either love it or flip it.  Occasionally, you are confused and uncertain, but if you are patient and open-minded, it may not be long before something pulls you in, and that something is the essence of KDVS.  

KDVS has the second or third largest vinyl collection in California, rivalled only by some loner guy in San Francisco and perhaps KZSU at Stanford University.  Neither KDVS or KZSU has been successful in counting each and every record and CD they have compiled, so this issue remains a point of contention (albeit a point of friendly contention).

KDVS also publishes a quarterly programming guide called KDViationS, featuring the programming schedule, program descriptions, interviews with musical artists, record and CD reviews, columns, and occasionally entertaining lists and poetry.  KDViationS is distributed throughout the Sacramento Valley at record stores and coffeehouses, plus many campus locations.  Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending upon how much you like pale skinny kids), you're not likely to see naked KDVS people on the program guide anymore:

 ''Shockingly, in the fall of 1986, the KDVS staff posed nude for the center photo of the program guide.  The news hit the Associated Press wire and the station attracted national coverage.  A stamp disclaiming that the opinions expressed in the guide were not necessarily those of the UC Regents was mandated by the administration before distribution.'' (From the [http://asucd.ucdavis.edu/radio/history.cfm?title=History KDVS history page])

= Legacy =
Freeform KDVS's legacy reaches much further than its broadcast range; consider two of this city's most famous musical exports, Michael Franti and DJ Shadow.  Both grew up listening to KDVS and were exposed to the many genres of music regularly played on the air, and each grew up to become musicians who mixed diverse sets of influences to create unique artistic visions that have become successful in creating diverse legacies.  Franti's first band, the Beatnigs, mixed punk rock, industrial music, funk, and Afrobeat influences with messages of African-American political consciousness-raising.  A palpable punk and industrial flavor was still evident in his next band, the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy.  Finally, with Spearhead, Franti broke through to mainstream audiences and played a large role in the proliferation of jazz-based hip hop and more consciousness-raising.

Shadow, a former KDVS DJ, combined hip hop with applications of electronic music (even relating to musique concrete) including unprecendented applications of sampling, recontextualizing music from genres such as hardcore punk and psych/acid-rock.  The immediate result was a spark in interest of "record digging," wherein hip hop, house, and techno DJ's plundered stacks of used vinyl records looking for the most obscure and overlooked breaks and beats.  DJ Shadow's own wide perspective of music became contagious.

As one of the first radio stations to broadcast on the internet, KDVS expanded its reputation and influence to far corners of the planet; and despite rules against archiving radio broadcasts, KDVS has followed the lead of WFMU in archiving its programs at its website to allow listeners everywhere to listen more selectively.  Through their web presence, KDVS has firmly established itself among an elite handful of radio stations nationally--and even internationally--when it comes to exposing important, challenging, and under-exposed new music as well as revealing forgotten nuggets of the past.

Many KDVS staff also play significant roles in bringing live music to the community through their promoting and organizing efforts.  That an underground music scene exists at all in Davis and Sacramento is possibly only because of KDVS.

= Getting Involved =
Anyone can be a DJ if they volunteer. Attend one of the volunteer meetings and you're ready to work at the station. To have your own show, you have to volunteer 50 hours (unless you have a co-host, in which case you split your hours). There are always plenty to do at the station. The most popular job may be censoring new music, which gets you exposed to new, exciting (most times) obscure bands. DJs are required to volunteer at least 40 hours per quarter, in addition to their shows. But even if you are not an on-air personality, there's plenty of behind the scenes work that goes on, including: Website, Programming, Office, Production, Publicity, Music Department.
