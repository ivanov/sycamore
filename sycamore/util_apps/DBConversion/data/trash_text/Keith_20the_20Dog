Keith the Dog lives with ["MikeyBurke"] at the ["Empty House"].  Keith has learned, under extensive training, how to high five.  He has also learned how to talk*.  I think, under these circumstances, Keith should have more rights than most babies (some of them don't even know how to high five, and most of them don't know how to talk).  So please, allow Keith to enter your store, house, or restaurant.  He certainly doesn't like sitting in the car unless it is moving.  

*so far he can only say hello

Dear Keith is a mix of African Basenji and Austrailian Shepherd.  His ears perk up, making him look like a coyote. He has a number of hobbies: wrestling with ["BrettHart"], ["RishiTrivedi"] and ["MikeyBurke"], making out with ["BudCutino"] and stealing the food of ["GonzaloEyzaguirre"] and ["JenndelaVega"].

Keith is able to stand on his hind legs for very long periods of time.
