Campus is where ["UC Davis"] sits, for the most part.  While the University owns a '''lot''' of land outside of Campus, Campus is really where the hardcore academics happen.

We've got some:

  * ["Cal Aggie Student Alumni Network"]
  * ["Campus Buildings"]
  * ["Campus Lecture Halls"]
  * ["Classroom Technology Services"]
  * ["Student Organizations"]
  * ["Campus Art"]
  * ["Spots And Places"]
  * ["Colleges"] and ["Professional Schools"]
  * ["Dorms"]
  * ["Scholarships"]
The Campus is expanding and is undergoing ["University Construction" nearly constant construction].  If you decide to drive to Campus, your ["Automobiles" car] is under the jurisdiction of ["Transportation And Parking Services" TAPS] -- so be careful where you park!  If you're smart you'll use an ["Transportation" alternative form of transportation.]

Many people exist on campus so much that ["Sleeping On Campus"] becomes a good option.  With that in mind, we all want to know where the ["Cleanest Bathrooms"] are.
