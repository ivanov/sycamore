The decor is uninspiring, but the donuts are tasty and the Vietnamese sandwiches are delicious if you're not Vietnamese.

Prices are low by Davis standards.  Recommended.  Also, perfect for ["All-Nighters" all nighters].  ''"If we stay up another hour we can get donuts."''

''"5 am is the latest.  I used to live across the alley at ["Sycamore Lane Apartments" Sycamore Lane Apartments] and could have probably thrown something at fluffy donuts from my porch.  Oftentimes it would be open at 4am.  However, this was under a previous owner.  These days, it will very often be open at about 4:30 every day.  The closing time is rather indeterminant.  Usually about 4 or 5 pm on weekdays and about 2 on weekends. I recommend their apple fritters."'' -["ChristopherMcKenzie"]

Though ownership has changed over the years, Fluffy's has been a Davis institution. I'm not sure when it opened, but it was originally in the space now occupied by Starbucks. Through frequent mall tenant turnover, Fluffy and ["The Graduate" the Grad] have weathered the storm.
