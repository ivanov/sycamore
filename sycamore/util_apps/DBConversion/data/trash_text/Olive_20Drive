Sandwiched between the train tracks and ["Interstate 80" I-80], Olive Drive, AKA Body-Part Drive in ["South Davis"] is the official ghetto of Davis.

Though it had already established itself as the shadiest area of Davis, the street gained real notoriety when someone living on the street tried to dispose of several hundred pounds of human remains - by placing tupperware containers of body-parts out with the trash.

It is also home to a number of very impressive cork oak trees, many of which are on the [http://www.city.davis.ca.us/pcs/trees/landmark.cfm City of Davis Landmark Trees list].
