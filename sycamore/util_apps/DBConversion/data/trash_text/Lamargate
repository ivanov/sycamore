"Lamargate" is a term (coined by a member of the ["Students for an Orwellian Society"]) to describe the illegal endorsement of political candidates such as Lamar Heystek^1^ by ["ASUCD"].  Because of the way that ["ASUCD"] files its taxes, they are forbidden from endorsing political candidates.  They did so anyway:

 * [http://californiaaggie.com/article/?id=2898 Consideration of endorsements].
 * [http://californiaaggie.com/article/?id=2960 Passed unanimously] the endorsements of Lamar Heystek, Stephen Souza and Don Saylor (Davis City Council), and an endorsement of Mariko Yamada for the ["Yolo County"] District Elections.
 * During late fall quarter, 2004, it became clear that the issue would basically [http://californiaaggie.com/article/?id=6728 blow over].  Additional legislation was passed to make future endorsements' legality more clear.


Because of these endorsements, ["ASUCD"] may have to pay back tens of thousand of dollars in taxes, possibly millions should the IRS decide to impose fines.  ["Igor Birman"] is credited as being the first to tell ["ASUCD"] to stop the endorsements.  In fact he notified the ASUCD Executive Office in an open letter that their activities were illegal and gave them something like two or three weeks to cease and dissest or else he would notify the IRS.  ASUCD in response publicly stated that they were doing nothing illegal.  Despite the testimony by a law professor interviewed by an Aggie reporter on the subject who said yes it was illegal, they did not appear at that time to actually investigate the legality.  Igor consequently informed the IRS, who eventually informed ASUCD that yes they were behaving illegally, and apparently the IRS has been working with ASUCD to investigate the situation and see that ASUCD ceases endorsements.

Oh shit?

After the scandal came to attention, the ["Senate"] passed a constitutional amendment explicitly stating that endorsements are in conflict with tax code and are thereby prohibited.  To become part of the constitution, it will require a majority vote of all students in Winter 2005, but it will likely pass, showing the IRS that the situation will be remedied.  ASUCD Executive branch members feel that this showing of good faith will go a long way in getting to the IRS to forgive their fiscal iniquity.


"Lamargate" is somewhat of a misnomer, as within something like a three month period ["ASUCD"] went around endorsing practically everything they could, Lamar being merely the tip of a very large and scandalous iceberg.  But since [http://californiaaggie.com/article/?id=6348 Lamar doesn't mind], the name stays.  After all, the Watergate Hotel didn't cause the scandal that made it world-famous.
