This campus organization is run by students who bravely divert food waste from the landfill. Instead it ends up in giant piles where our microbial friends heat it up and decompose it into what's known as "black gold", pure unadulterated compost. Their offices are located in lower freeborn and the compost itself is kept on the student farm. They also compost literally tons of waste from ["Whole Earth Festival"]. If you have never sorted re-cycleables and compost for ["Whole Earth Festival" WEF] you simply don't know what you are missing. You might even find a ["groundscore"].
