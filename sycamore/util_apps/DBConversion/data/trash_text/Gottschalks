Gottschalks is like a mini version of Macy's.  Not the place to go if you're poor^1^.  It's right next to ["Cost Plus World Market"], which is where ["Harvest Market"] used to be.

They have a decent selection of basic items, but they're not big enough to replace the need to go to [http://www.macys.com Macy's] or [http://www.nordstrom.com Nordstorm] in ["Sacramento"] for people who like that kind of a thing.  For guys, it's a good place to buy a quick set of dress clothes.

1. With the exception of ["Thrift Stores"] it's probably the least expensive place to buy clothing in ["Davis"].  However the clearance rack at ["The GAP"] is also full of value-priced merchandise that probably was never in the regular stock in the first place.
