Sue (or Susan) is 23 years old and has lived at The ["Loyola House"] for the past couple years.  She graduated UCD in December 2003 with a B.S. in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior and a B.S. in Psychology with an emphasis in biology.

Currently, she works full time at the UCD Center for Neuroscience as a Research Assistant, and is a full time graduate student at the University of New Haven (the Sac campus) getting her M.S. in Forensic Science.  On the side, she helps out a little with ["Davis Music Scene"].

She is also originally from New Jersey, a total nerd, and is dating ["TheRadish"].


Finally, talking about herself in the 3rd person makes her a wee bit uncomfortable.
