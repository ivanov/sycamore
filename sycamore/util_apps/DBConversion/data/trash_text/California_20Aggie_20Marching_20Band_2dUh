the California Aggie Marching Band-uh!''

The Marching Band-Uh! is one of the most insane of the ["Student Organizations"]. They are student-run, and everything that they do is heavily based on many traditions. These guys are total ''band dorks'', and proud of it. The still like to use the ["Oldschool Aggie Logo"].

Anyone can become a member of the Banduh, provided that they are a current student at UCD, and willing to put up with all of the Band's tradtions.

== General Traditions ==
These are just a few of the many things that the band does.

 * They always stay around after games and play a few songs, then ["Aggie Fight"].
 * They ring the ["Victory Bell"] after every home football game.
 * They do things how the Alumni did them when they were in the ["Aggie Band"].
 * ["Band-Uh Sushi Challenge"].

There's really only one way to know EVERY tradtion the Band has. Join it! 

== Interested? ==
To join, just show up to one of their ["Monday Night Rehersals"].  Or, to see them perform, just go to any of the games!

They have an [http://camb.ucdavis.edu/camb/ official web site]. (Out of date, but soon to be updated!)

''One day, I was in the ["CoHo"] and a bunch of people were banging on their table with their cups and their books, trying to make some spur of the moment music. It went on for about 10 minutes and seemed really unusual because of the amount of noise and attention they were drawing to themselves. But, it was all explained once we figured out they were just from the Marching Band Uh.'' - ["PhilipNeustrom"]

''Yeah, the Banduh usually has a table somewhere in the ["CoHo"]. And it's usually in the same place too...'' - ["ThomasFifield"]
