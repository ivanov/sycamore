["Ben & Jerry's"] is having a "Conquer the Vermonster" challenge to benefit the American Red Cross in their aid of Tsunami victims. How it works is, teams of four get at least one hundred dollars in pledges and then they race to see who can finish the Vermonster first. The winning team gets a years supply of free ice cream. There will be only 20 teams so each team needs to try to raise the most amount of money as possible in order to compete. More details will be coming soon. Email {{{voterobroy@gmail.com}}} for more info.

The Vermomster is a ["Ben & Jerry's"] giant 40 dollar hot fudge sundae that consists of twenty scoops of ice cream (which is roughly four and a half pounds), three cookies, four bananas, one brownie, four ladles of hot fudge, ten scoops of peanuts, three scoops of sprinkles, three scoops of M&Ms, and a whole lot of whip cream.

If you want one from the ["Ben & Jerry's"] in Davis it is best to call ahead.

''2004-12-18 19:35:58'' [[nbsp]] I have worked at ["Ben & Jerry's"] for over five years and have seen many people try to eat the Vermnoster on their own and they fail every time. When I was working in Berkeley I saw the School band forse 4 blindfolded ["Freshmen"] to eat one. They finished in 15 minutes. But I think a couple of them threw up.  - ["RobRoy"]

''2005-01-03 06:07:36'' [[nbsp]] My least favorite thing about the Vermonster is what a melted amalgam of sorrow it is by the time one has reached the bottom layers. It's just not a pleasant visual. --["TravisGrathwell"]

''2005-01-22 13:05:11'' [[nbsp]] The ["Jewish Student Union"] had a Vermonster Challenge - about 10 students eating one Vermonster.  All I can say is that it was probably the most unhygenic experience I've ever had. --["LizaInfeld"]------
