The original name of ["Redrum Burger"]. It was changed because the owner that it would scare the people of FOlsom and Rocklin when he expanded out the a couple years ago. Now he only has the Davis Redrum Burger and changing the name from murder turned out to be a waste - because they really are "to die for."
