= Undergraduate Major =

The undergraduate major in International Relations is an '''interdisciplinary program''' focusing on economic, security, environmental and socio-cultural issues affecting the global community. There are four basic tracts to choose from:


 * World Trade & Development: 
       * Main courses - Economics, 2 possible sub-focuses: Developing Economies, Advanced Economies
 * Peace and Security: 
       * Main courses - Political Science, history, political philosophy, social conflict sociology 
 * Global Environment, Health & Natural Resources: 
       * Main courses - ESP, ATM, ERS, GEL, AMR, ETX - if you don't know what those are, this probably wouldn't be your focus
 * People and Nationalities: 
       * Main courses - Anthropology, globalization, ethnicity studies, urban sociology studies, colonialism

Because IR is a program and not a department per se, most major courses include: history, political science, sociology, anthropology, economics, and language courses. A lot of courses however - if they fit in your tract also count as well, even if they're from Community Regional Development, Geography, Drama, Women Studies, African-Studies, East Asian Studies, Religious Studies, or even International Agricultural Development.
