This is where some ["engineering students"] at UCD spend most of their days (and nights).  ["Computer Science"] students live in the [[s(begin)]]dungeon[[s(end)]] basement labs.  Some say that there is a spaceship underground at the heart of the building.

Kemper Hall was formerly known as Engineering Unit 2, aka EUII, EU][, "Engineering 2" or simply "Engineering" for some.  If you look closely at the picture, you can see where they popped the "II" off. 

Little-known fact: There is an honest to goodness surgery robot in the basement of this building.[[BR]]
Better-known fact: There are no medical students working in this building (or at least not that I know of).[[BR]]
Draw your own conclusions.

Other buildings in the College of Engineering include ["Bainer Hall"] and ["EU III"].

''Some of us old timers remember when the building was called EUII. So we've found EUII and EUIII. We've also noticed the same pattern with the dorms: Segundo, Tercero, Cuarto, (and Primero Grove is the newest and it's apartments). So we really want to know: why does this school only start counting with 2?''

''My understanding is that ["Bainer Hall" Bainer] was the first Engineering building and hence "Engineering I"''

''Actually the first engineering building was ["Walker Hall"] and if you look at the name above the door on it still says "ENGINEERING" eventhough the is obsecured by trees and the building has long since been converted for other uses. -AshleyOrsaba''
