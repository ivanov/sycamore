= General information =
A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didgeridoo didjeridu] is a hollow pipe typically 4-6 feet long and around 2" in diameter, though a wide range of sizes exist.  Usually a mouth-piece of wax or hardened gum is on one end and the player blows into the instrument in a trumpet like fashion.  The instrument originated from the indigenous people of Australia, and they call it the yidaki.  It is arguably the oldest known musical wind instrument, dating back at least 40,000 years.  Many didjeridu players have learned the method known as circular breathing in order to keep the didjeridu buzzing without stopping for a breath.  The "trick" is to maintain air pressure, without blowing, by using your mouth like the airbag of a bagpipe while you inhale through your nose.

Didjeridu has a variety of names/spellings, including:
  * didjeridu
  * didjeridoo
  * didgeridu
  * didgeridoo
  * didj  
  * yirdaki
  * yidaki
  * yedaki


Didjeridus are often associated with new-age ["Hippies" hippie] type people that like to use them for things like spiritual sound healings.
