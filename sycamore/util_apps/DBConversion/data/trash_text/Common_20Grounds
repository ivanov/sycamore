Common Grounds is a coffee shop.

They have a '''lot''' of couches and comfy chairs, as well as ["WiFi Hot Spots" wireless internet]. (Well, a few 
couches anyway).

The place looks a lot like "Central Perk" from the TV show Friends, kinda.

Decent coffee.  Although people are less inclined to share tables as they are at Mishka's cafe when it gets packed.  

Never too cold like Starbuck's tends to be.
