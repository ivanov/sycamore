"Hugh "Pat" Patterson regaled generations of future doctors in his anatomy courses, and in return they showered him with awards and devotion.

But recently, the beloved educator's work had apparently become too much to bear. On a clear October morning, in one of his favorite spots on the UC Davis campus, Patterson, 61, hanged himself from an oak tree. A crumpled note stuffed in his pocket said he was unable to cope with his "impending failure" in a course he was teaching." - (Cynthia Hubert, Sacramento Bee 11/16/2003)

''Yes, ], according to the ["California Aggie"].  I believe it was a UCSF professor though, who everybody totally liked.  I'll see if I can find the main article I read.'' - ["BrentLaabs" bl]

["Andrew Wieman"], a 20-year-old junior from Eureka, California, was found in his room at the ["Kappa Sigma"] fraternity house with multiple stab wounds to the neck and chest. The Yolo County Coroner's Office has determined the cause of Wieman's death to be from those wounds.  ["UCD Fire and Police" Investigators] [http://www-dateline.ucdavis.edu/021502/DL_wieman.html declared the death a suicide] although prior to the incident Wieman's behavior did not indicate that he was feeling suicidal, he had [http://www.sacbee.com/content/news/story/1622688p-1698870c.html 29 stab wounds].  A suicide note was found at the scene and the writing was determined to be Andrew's.  The death was initially ruled "suspicous" but after a year in this pending status, the Yolo County Coroner's Office ruled to it by suicide.  While the UC Davis Department headed the investigation, the California Deptartment of Justice was brought in to assist.  After the death was ruled to be a suicide, Andrew's parents hired a private investigor to re-examine the evidence.  This investigator determined that the death was the result of a homicide, but the case was not reopened by the police.

 * I remember hearing that he was stabbed 27 times in the back. This happened before I (["KenBloom"]) came to Davis in Fall 2001. The police ruled this a suicide, but I can't believe that a person could have enough motor control to stab himself the 27th time.
  * Andrew's wounds were to his neck and chest -- not back. -''["PaulLanzi"]''
 * Many people who have been in the Greek system for awhile claim that this death was probably the result of a homicide, not a suicide. Apparently the Wiemen (who I believe was the President of ["Kappa Sigma"] at the time) and the rest of his fraternity had a rivalry with one of the neighboring fraternities due to a history of violent past events. Many claim that brothers from the rival fraternity killed Wieman, and set  it up to look like a suicide, forging a note and everything. However this is all JUST a rumor, but a lot of people consider this a possible theory for his mysterious death. - ["AbbyLawson"]
  * Andrew was not an officer in ["Kappa Sigma"] at the time -''["PaulLanzi"]''
 * Having known Andrew since junior high school, it is my opinion, and the opinion of his parents, a private investigator hired by his parents, his close Eureka friends and his fraternity brothers that his death was the result of a criminal act -- not suicide.  -''["PaulLanzi"]''

[[Anchor(knife)]]''I can't seem to find any information on this claim about the knife not being tied to the murder.  According to [http://www-dateline.ucdavis.edu/021502/DL_wieman.html this article]: "Further investigation revealed the knife believed to have caused the wounds had belonged to Wieman and contained his fingerprints."  This seems completely different from what is said here, and if we don't get some sort of source then it'd be best to fix this.'' - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
