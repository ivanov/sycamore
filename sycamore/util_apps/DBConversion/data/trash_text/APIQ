APIQ is a group for individuals who identify as both Asian-Pacific Islander and ["LGBTRC" LGBTQIA]. Established in 2002, APIQ provides a safe space and support group for fellow members who can understand and relate to experiences faced as an Asian or Asian-American Queer. Meetings are held nearly every week to discuss family life, social life, and other pertaining issues that are unique to APIQs. Social events are also frequent, and often open to non-APIQ members as well. The organization has become increasingly active, participating in tabling and other outreach events to promote visibility and awareness.  

Meetings are closed to members only in order to provide confidentiality and a safe space for its members. To find out more about the group or if you'd like to become a member, visit [http://www.ucdapiq.com] or email apiqcore@ucdavis.edu
