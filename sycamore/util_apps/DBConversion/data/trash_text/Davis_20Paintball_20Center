The Davis Paintball Center has two fields right on one of the county's oldest landfills. Games happen every weekend rain or shine (although when the wind is blowin hard enough to rip the bunkers out of the ground they close). You usually want to get there around opening time so that you can play most of the day. One course has large inflatable bunkers and lots of more experienced people. the daring noob is always welcome. Watch out because some of the people you are playing with have been playing for a while. To the right is the more tame course where most of the beginners can play. The field is dominated by a plywood "castle" that the two teams battle in and around. but remember you can always request private games with people of your own skill level.

Paintball is a surprisingly fun activity for the weekend. Get a group of friends together and head on out. It can be quite pricey however. Occasionally they will be selling discounted tickets on campus, although its usually the same price even without the ticket. With one, a day will cost about $20-25. Otherwise you are looking at over $35. Unless of course you have your own equipment. 

 Those tix that they sell on campus dont really do anything.  I was talking to a guy who works there yesterday and he was saying that they hate having to tell you guys that those tix are junk. - ["BibbleFoshizzle"]
