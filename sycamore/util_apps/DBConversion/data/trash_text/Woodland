Woodland, while not properly part of Davis, is within the ken of residents of the ["PRD"].  Its primary virtues are cheap housing, a relative paucity of students, and mass-market superstores (if that's your thing) / ["Thrift Stores"] (if you're into that.)  It is also the county seat of ["Yolo County"], making it a potentially necessary trip for various legal reasons.

For the desperate and those who fear ["Tapioca Express"], the arcade in Woodland's ["County Fair Mall"] has a ["DDR"] Extreme machine.  The machine's in good shape and costs 3 tokens/4 songs.  If you're looking to get a ["Animals" pet], then the ["Yolo County Animal Shelter"] is a great alternative to ["Petco"].

Socially acceptable means of traveling to Woodland include [http://yolobus.org Yolobus] route 42 and ["Highway 113"].  A more scenic (and still socially acceptable) route is to take Pole Line all the way down.  Go until you get to Gibson (Left to County Fair Mall), or Main (left to Downtown and Wal-Mart).

The bike ride from Davis to Woodland can also be quite pleasant, if you're the kind of person that ''bikes to Woodland''. Spaz.  But beware, there are no bike lanes most of the way there.  In fact, there are virtually no bike lanes.

Actually, if you are the sort who likes to bike places, then Pole Line road is actually a decent way to get out there. On Pole Line, there are nice wide shoulders that look a lot like bike lanes. If you like it a little more scenic, then there are plenty of low-traffic county roads starting from West Davis that will take you out there. These roads, of course, have no bike lanes, only about a 6 inch shoulder. - ["EricKlein"]
