Blockbuster is equipped with special magenetic devices that beep when people try to steal videos.  It also erases your mind so that you can't remember all those good ["Movies" movies] you've been meaning to rent.

They now sell memberships so you can have ["Movies" movies] for indefinite periods, and have also started an online ["Movies" movie] rental service so they can compete with [http://www.netflix.com Netflix].

They are also the most expensive ["Movies" movie] rental place in town. Try ["Videos To Go"] or ["49er Video"] if you don't want to pay an arm and leg - because you really don't have to.
