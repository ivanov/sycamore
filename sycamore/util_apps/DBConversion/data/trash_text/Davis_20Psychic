Located in the "almost residential" section of ["Downtown" downtown] on E Street, Davis Psychic has a very visible billboard on I-80, so it is one of the first things that visitors driving from the east see.  That plus the Green and Nuclear Free billboards.  As a result, the Davis Psychic is almost iconic of Davis, although few have gone.
