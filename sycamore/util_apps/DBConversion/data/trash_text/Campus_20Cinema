Campus Cinema, once it's own ASUCD unit, is now part of the ["ASUCD Entertainment Council" Entertainment Council] at ["UC Davis"].  Often the ["Movies" movies] that are shown are free sneak previews, either a few days before release, or screening tests several months in advance.  Campus Cinema presents its movies in full 35mm film, and digital sound at ["Chem 194"].

Campus Cinema also shows a wide variety of movies - blockbusters no longer in theaters but not yet on DVD, documentaries, and some obscure art house films and cult classics such as ["Further Indignities" The Rocky Horror Picture Show]

Campus Cinema sometimes partners with other groups on campus to show films for them or related to their activities.  If you or your group would like to arrange a show, contact ["SarahHillard" Sarah Hillard]

Campus Cinema is currently run by ["SarahHillard" Sarah Hillard].

Campus Cinema started life as part of the Memorial Union regular activities showing 16mm films. Later, with the founding of ASUCD it became Entertainment Board Films. Finally in the 80's it became so large as to branch off on it's own as ASUCD Campus Cinema with a new facility in Chemistry 194 with twin 35mm projectors donated by Dolby. Previous Directors were Aaron Brown (2002-2003), James Hirsh (2001-2002), Christie Koehler (1999-2001)...
