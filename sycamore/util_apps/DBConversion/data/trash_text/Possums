One of the more robust backyard visitors is the Possum. Often in search of catfood left out they are often noticed by the volume with which they chew dry catfood. Possums will establish a territory and a route that they will follow. They are not frightened easily and will stand their ground and hiss loudy if cornered.

Opossums cannot get rabies (their metabolism is too slow or something) and are not particularly dangerous in any other way.  Having a possum about is actually a very effective way to eliminate the snails from one's garden.

Possums can be domesticated and potty trained.  It is recommended that you do not try this with an adult possum, but if one finds an injured baby possum, nursing it back to health and either keeping it as a pet or shleffing it off to someone else as a pet (your benevolent attention may have rendered it unqualified for the rough life of the Davis urban wilds) might be a larf.  Once you run out of snails to feed them, they also like hardboiled eggs.  ["KrisFricke" Kris Fricke] once had a pet possum.

This one isn't playing, but it does show the usual coat color and tail.

''2005-01-23 23:45:51'' [[nbsp]] Maybe the possums around here are smaller or something, but I have scars that dispute the "are not particularly dangerous".  Ever see what their mouth looks like open?  Incidently, shouldn't this page be "Opossum"? --["JabberWokky"]------
''2005-01-24 02:38:44'' [[nbsp]] There ain't no one who don't call 'em possums! --["BrentLaabs"]------
''2005-01-24 13:50:47'' [[nbsp]] Yes I am have seen "what theiri mouths look like open" - they have sixty teeth.  I've even received some friendly gnaws from my pet possum. --["KrisFricke"]
