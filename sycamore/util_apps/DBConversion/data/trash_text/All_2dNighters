= Paper-writing =

Pulling an all-nighter is a rite of passage that separates ["Procrastinating" procrastinators] from those students who study and write papers in a timely fashion.  The root of most ["Procrastinating" procrastination] is perfectionism.  OR laziness.  Or both.  But generally, even if a paper is due the next day, a ["Procrastinating" procrastinating] perfectionist won't even get started until late into the ["Night Time" night], because she's lacks the inspiration to write ["The perfect paper" that perfect paper].  Inspiration and desperation, at a certain hour, become interchangeable.  So by about 3am, the wheels of creativity turn out 7-10 pp, double spaced.  So what if it has 1.5" margins and is in Courier, the largest font known to TrueType or Postscript fonts?

= Test-taking =

While all-nighters can be essential for paper-writing, they are actually counter-productive for most types of studying.  If someone is fairly good with material, and they pull an all-nighter to perfect their knowledge, their ensuing loss of mental clarity due to lack of sleep, probably more-than-offsets their increased knowledge due to a night of studying.  However, this can produce a net gain, if the student never actually went to class.
 * I can attest from my undergrad days taking certain liberal arts classes that the cramming all-nighter can be quite effective. If you are sufficiently motivated, you can in fact read 400 pages of psych text in two nights of reading, and still get an A on the material (assuming of course that there are 800 people in the class, so the only conceivable test type is multiple choice. Never try this if it is an essay test). -["EricKlein"]
 * Dude, actually reading 800 pages is the most inefficient way of studying for a psych test I've ever heard of.  But okay, maybe it works for multiple choice tests. -["JaimeRaba" jr]
 * Well, perhaps, but it does work. If the only material for the class is the textbook, and you've already been to all the lectures and sections, then just reading all of the text actually crams quite a lot of useful test info into your head. Of course, I suspect this wouldn't work for most people, but I have a pretty good memory, and read fairly fast.  -["EricKlein"]

= Techniques =
== Sugar ==
["Sugar"] if consumed in regular intervals, will keep you energized and awake.  However, if you fail to continually introduce sugar into your body, you will quickly feel sleepy.  Essentially your body will raise your insulin levels, which has the direct effect of fatigue and lethargy.

== Caffeine ==
["Caffeine"] is an essential part of maintaining the all-nighter.  Unlike sugar, it can keep you going all night without the risk of sudden fatigue.  However one must be mindful of the caffeine source.  If someone drinks REGULAR soda, such as Mountain Dew or Coke, they run the risk of an insulin surge once the sugar runs its course through your metabolism.  This CAN (although not necessarily) be dramatic enough an effect to offset the caffeine.  Some people describe the insulin versus caffeine reaction as "very alert tiredness."  Diet soda, however, does not contain sugar.  While it tastes somewhat gross, if you drink it somewhat regularly, your taste buds will desensitize to its sharp aftertaste.  Another trick is to squeeze lemon or lime into your diet soda -- you can also buy a bottle of RealLemon or RealLime.

=== Sugar-free caffeine sources ===
 *  Diet soda
     *  Diet Mountain Dew - This citrusy soft drink contains enough lime flavor to make the aspartamine undetectable.  It tastes slightly better than regular Mountain Dew because it has more lime and less orange flavor.
     *  Diet Red Bull - Tastes horrible.  Some people have other ideas.  However, highly effective.
     *  Some people claim that diet sodas containing Splenda makes them lethargic.
 *  No-Doze - be careful with these.  these can make your stomach hurt SO bad.
  * Careful with these. As few as 20 can kill some people. :)
 *  Tea - Avoid caffeine-free tea.  Theoretically the caffeine in tea has a slightly different molecular composition than caffeine in other things.  It affects certain people somewhat differently.
 *  Black coffee - or add a non-sugar sweetener.
 *  Espresso shots - very effect, but be wary of upset tummies.
 *  Chocolate covered espresso beans - great idea, but watch out for the sugar content.
 *  Excedrin - advanced medicine for pain.  Has plenty of caffeine.  Don't take too much, but it also helps take care of the headache and neckache you probably have already.

== Sleep ==
A Quick Nap is theoretically possible.  Some all-night avatars can actually take 45 minute power naps so they can sustain themselves all night without the use of additives.  However, most people cannot do this.  This ultimately causes people to sleep through alarms and miss finals, deadlines and other horrible consequences.  This ultimately results in claims of rare, spontaneous illnesses. Food poisoning is a popular one, due to its unprovable nature.  (Some purists claim that even a short nap takes away the honorable designation of pulling an all-nighter.)
 * I once stayed up for two nights straight working on a final project for a class. I finished the project at 8am on the morning it was due (I had to present at 11am or so), so I went home to have a shower. After the shower, I sat down on the bed, and the next thing I knew, it was 12:30, well after class was over. Quite luckily, my professor had a sense of humor about it, and since I went straight to his office to present it to him in person, everything worked out OK, but still the stuff nightmares are made of. Moral of the story: if you REALLY need to stay up, don't ever do anything that could even make you comfortable enough to fall asleep. Once you are tired enough to have your mind spontaneously stop thinking, sleep can strike at any time. -["EricKlein"]
 * I've found anything less than three hours is worse than not sleeping at all, since it just makes you crave what you're missing and slows down your spinning head. Plus the sleep is always fitful with dreams about failing to wakeup again.  -["AmeliaCarlson" aec]
 * I agree.  Three hours can work wonderfully, though.  It's long enough to refresh your mind to some degree, as you can actually dream during three hours -- expect dreams about your paper though.  I've never actually pulled an all-nighter, due to the fact that I usually think sleep deprivation effects will be worse.  But this Friday I went to sleep at 3AM, woke up at 6AM, finished my project, and still managed to stay awake until 1AM the next day.  Note that when you wake up, you'll probably want to take a ''hot'' shower to start up your metabolism. - ["BrentLaabs"]
