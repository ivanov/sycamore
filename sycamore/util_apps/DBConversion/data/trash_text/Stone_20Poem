''Stone Poem'' is one of many public ["Campus Art"] pieces. This sculpture was made by Steve Gillman in the 1980s. The core group of stones were originally exhibited in the Richard L. Nelson Gallery during April - May 1986. Before erecting the sculpture as public art on campus, it was in the artist's Oakland studio at the time of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Several of the stones were knocked over and broken as a result of the quake and were reincorporated as "benches" on the perimeter of the ["UC Davis"] site. ''Stone Poem'' is located east of South Silo and south of the Bike Barn.
