Pinkadot is that black and pink themed store around the corner from Baskin Robbins.  After women see the prices and sizes of these small pink scraps of material, they head straight over to Baskin Robbins.  In all seriousness, the prices are competitive with ["Savvy Shoppe"], but the selection isn't as good. Just another expensive boutique that students can't really afford.
