=== Silo Law Bookstore ===
Every savvy senior's favorite place to get a last-minute blue book, the Silo Law Bookstore is located at the eastern edge of ["The Silo"] building.  The entrance is under the awning and is somewhat difficult to recognize as a bookstore.  I have it on good authority, however, that they do sell books there, in addition to the precious, precious blue books.
'''Regular Hours'''
 * Monday - Friday, 8:00am - 4:00pm

=== Other locations ===
The UC Davis Bookstore also operates locations elsewhere in the MU (the ["Corral"], which doesn't sell books) and these other fine locations:

 * ["UC Davis Medical Center Bookstore"]

== Cost ==

The UCD Bookstore is fairly expensive, but not unreasonably so.  Most of its books sell at list.  Art supplies sell slightly below list and a bit above street.  The convenience of buying class supplies from a centralized, well-stocked location outweighs the price premium for most people.

The bookstore will also allow you to buy on credit, charging your student account.  There's a small fee for this service.  It should be noted that transactions on the student account never reveal the actual items purchased -- only the bookstore charge is noted.  This is especially important when attemping to buy frivolous items with your parent's money.

Unpopular [http://www.oreilly.com/ O'Reilly] books get aggressive discounts, sometimes dropping to 15% of list price.

== Anti-theft technology ==

The UCD Bookstore works hard to combat shoplifting, which is apparently endemic.  Even ["ASUCD"] senators have been ["Senator Ackerman Scandal" caught stealing from the bookstore].  Place bags in the lockers at the front of the store to keep from being yelled at by the policy enforcement drone.  Both men and women may carry in purse-sized bags.

The cameras mounted at the end of each aisle are not cheap plastic imitations -- they feed to a rather nice setup located in the offices behind the computer area, and are actually watched.

Also, spotters occasionally roam the store, dressed like normal shoppers.  They're pretty easy to recognize, displaying patterns of browsing not dissimilar to the shoplifters themselves.

== Brief aside ==

The computer shop at the rear of the store provides a few ''de facto'' public internet access machines.
