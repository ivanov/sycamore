Alpha Epsilon Pi: the surviving Jewish Fraternity of North America, was founded to provide opportunities for a Jewish man seeking the best possible college and fraternity experience. AEPi has maintained the integrity of our purpose by strengthening our ties to the Jewish community and serving as a link between high school and career. We send brothers to Israel, support Jewish life on campus and develop leadership for the future of the North American Jewish Community.

Currently AEPi at UC Davis holds the highest GPA out of all of the Greek Orgs.
