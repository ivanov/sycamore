Linguistics is a department in the ["Letters and Science" College of Letters and Science].  The department is housed in the 2nd floor of ["Sproul Hall"] but due to a shortage of office space, several faculty members have their offices off-campus in a suite at the corner of B St. and 2nd (200 B St., Suite A).  For detailed course and faculty info not found below please see the [http://linguistics.ucdavis.edu department web site].

== Courses ==

=== Lower Division ===
''LIN 1 - Intro to Linguistics'' - An introductory course for majors and non-majors alike, this introduces all the areas of linguistics: phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax. It also may include a discussion of language features and language acquisition. It's an easy course if you take it from professor ["Ojeda"].

''LIN 4 - Linguistics for Students of Literature'' - A course primarily for those studying literature, i.e. ["English"] and ["Comparative Literature"] majors.

''LIN 50 - Languages of the World'' (this was bumped up to course 150 with upper division status for at least one year but apparently has been moved back to lower division since)

=== Upper Division ===
''LIN 103A - Linguistic Analysis I''

''LIN 103B - Linguistic Analysis II''

''LIN 105 - Topics in Language and Linguistics''

''LIN 106 - English Grammar''

''LIN 111 - Intro to Phonological Theory''

''LIN 112 - Phonetics''

''LIN 121: Morphology''

''LIN 131: Intro to Syntactic Theory''

''LIN 141: Semantics (philosophy people should find this one very interesting)''

''LIN 151: Historical Linguistics''

''LIN 152: Language Universals and Typology''

''LIN 177: Computational Linguistics'' - A class about working with human language on computers. Programs are written in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog Prolog]. The professor's goal is to have the class 50% linguistics majors and 50% ["Computer Science"] majors, but that doesn't seem to be working yet.''["KenBloom"] is taking this class right now. More information to come after he's spent time in the class.''

Some faculty members:
 * '''Will Benware.'''  Grandfatherly figure and one of the clearest speakers you may ever have the pleasure of hearing.  Usually teaches 103A, 151 and 50.
 * '''Patrick Farrell.'''  A little bit twitchy.  Has been heard to use the word "shit" in class without it being part of data for analysis.  He is very receptive to students dropping by to discuss or argue about linguistic things.  Used to be the department undergraduate advisor and was honestly not an extremely helpful one, but seems to have been replaced in that role by Benware.  Usually teaches 131 and 152.
 * '''Raul Aranovich.''' His confusing name results from a Russian ethnic background but Argentinian nationality.  Usually teaches 103B and 121.
 * '''Jason Schneider.''' Young, possibly attractive, professor who teaches course 1. Very helpful and will make you want to switch majors.
