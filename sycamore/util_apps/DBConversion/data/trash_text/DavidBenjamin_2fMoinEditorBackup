I don't know how to do all that cool web stuff that makes my profile look supercool, so I just type boring sentences instead.  I won't be at UCD this next year, I'll studying abroad in the Netherlands, but I'll be back.

Maybe soon I'll learn how to put a picture in here, but until then, you'll have to go to my super-easy-to-make webpage, at http://homepage.mac.com/bltdave/

I also like the smell of cut grass.
