T. St. pub is THE hang out for the elite crowd of the Davis Scene. The Cool Club of Four (made up of ["TaylorStreet" Taylor], ["MattJojola" Matty], ["NAM TURK" NAM TURK], and ["DeannaBrusco" Deanna]) can usually be found raging hell in this tiny bedroom after almost any party in the small town of Davis. Other party goers are usually present as well, and the tiny abode has even been known to host even more elite than usual ["Study Parties"].
