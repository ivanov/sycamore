||attachment:aerial.jpg||<^>The Social Sciences and Humanities Building, designed by Southwest architect Antoine Predock, is a complex, five-storied maze-like building of classrooms, labs, and offices. [[BR]][[BR]]It is commonly refered to as the ["Death Star"] by students, since it is such a maze. [[BR]][[BR]]Supposedly, if you were to fly over it, it looks like a topographic map of California. However, the resemblance is loose at best, as can be seen from this aerial photo (rotated for clarity--North is actually to the left).||
[[BR]]The architecture certainly is striking, though:

[[BR]]It really isn't this grim looking in person.  Some of the architectural details are downright lighthearted, like the juxtaposition of outdoor carpet with indoor tile, or the fuzzy rooms.  People have been known to describe the style as "Brutalism Lite," but this label is meaningful only in the vaguest possible sense.

[[BR]]Drunken students often make their way to the top of the west tower late at night, as the tower commands a view of most of the bits of ["Campus" campus] that are worth looking at.  (It should be noted that the university frowns upon this practice.)

Not everybody likes the design of the building (though certainly the admin officials that approved it and the architect loved it).  It replaced a parking lot, which was the site of the original Unitrans depot. Before that, this was the approximate location of the football field before it was moved a bit north to become the ["Toomey Field"] you know today.
