Some conceive of cheap food to mean: "I have one dollar, what can I buy?"  Still, others mean: "If I buy something, will I get a good value for my money?"  We'll look at both questions below.

= Dirt Cheap =
 * ["Wok n' Roll"] - $0.79 Soup
 * ["Del Taco"] - $0.79 Chicken Soft Tacos
 * ["Jack in the Box"] - $0.99 Chicken Sandwhich or Breakfast Sandwhich.  Add $0.37 to add on toasted sourdough. Also 2 Tacos for $0.99
 * ["Taqueria Davis"] - Thursday and Saturday "Happy Hour" 8pm-9pm.  $1 tacos and beers.

= Surprising Value:  Price versus Quality =
 * ["El Mariachi"]'s Tortilla Soup - $1.99 It tastes excellent and isn't small.
 * ["Hunan"]'s Lunch Specials - Don't call it authentic, but call it a good deal.  Lunch specials start at $4.25 for rice (fried or steamed), pan fried noodles, hot tea, a "crab?" wanton, your choice of meat or veggie entree, and really lemony ice-water.  -["JaimeRaba" jr]
 * ["Guadalajara"]'s Breakfast Specials - $1.99 breakfast burrito ($1 for each extra burrito!), includes rice, beans, and they put any of their meats into their burritos.  Includes a drink (soda or coffee).
 * ["Pluto's"] Small Salad - Only $3.95, fully customizable, and big enough for a meal.  Add chicken or flank steak for $1 more.  (The large salad is definitely big enough for two at only a dollar more.)
 * ["In-N-Out"] - Anything at In-N-Out. ($1.29 to 3ish).  Try ordering from the ["In-N-Out Secret Menu"] -- it makes you feel like you're getting added value.
 * ["Nugget"] - Fried rice or chow mein's only $1.50 / quart if you get it at 8 PM, and a quart's enough to keep a person fed for about 24 hours.
