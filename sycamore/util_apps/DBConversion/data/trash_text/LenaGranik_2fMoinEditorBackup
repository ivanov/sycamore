We are three communal houses, located on Regan Hall Circle in the UC Davis campus (maps). Each house of about ten UC Davis students functions independently, but we also support each other and live together as a community.

Residents have tended to be vegetarian and environmentally aware. While these are not rules, current residents pick their future housemates with the goal of creating a harmonious community.  We have certain goals as a group, formulated into our Vision Statement.

Our tri-co-op projects include the large garden behind Agrarian Effort and smaller garden next to Davis Student, which help reduce reliance on outside food sources; as well as the Summer 2002 installation of a photovoltaic solar power array, which substantially reduces our reliance on outside energy sources.

The community prides itself on achieving sustainability through it's efforts in the garden.  The garden provides a large portion of their organic diet during the summer months.  Garden activities are not limited to the growing season as the weather in Davis allows for certain crops to successfully grow anytime during the year.  Next time you are nearby, come swing by our garden, see what's growing and enjoy the scenery.  

We generally have a couple spaces available every quarter, with more in the fall (and lots more for just the summer).  Also, sometimes people will move out with short notice.  If you're interested in living with us, drop by and check out the the house(s) of interest. (hint: be persistent!) Generally the houses have potluck dinners during which applicants and residents get to know each other. We also get acquainted by just hanging out at the houses. Check with individual houses on how they prefer to handle the applicant process. We'll probably show you around and then ask that you submit an [http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/PDF/form_Coops.pdf application], available at 160 Student Housing, as well as our two-page questionnaire which has some questions about your personality.

Don't forget to also check out our friends the ["The Domes" Domes], a unique example of an on-campus cooperative residential area.
