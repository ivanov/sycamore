Gena Rinaldi is an angsty girl.  In fact she is the official teen-angst representative of UC Davis. In order to better represent the angst-ridden student populous, she is running for ASUCD ["Senate"] with ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"].

She is obsessed with the Beatles, Ben Folds and the fine dining establishment Chevy's. She is currently the Under Secretary-General of Conference Preparation with [http://www.davismun.com Model United Nations] at UC Davis and will do nearly anything to get more volunteers for her conference. In her spare time, Gena is also a rebel and likes to mix it up. That's right, she's saucy. She hopes to one day take over the small nation of Russia and claim it as her own.

Like all rebels, Gena is a controversial figure and has been known to cause trouble with her [http://thiswallflower.livejournal.com livejournal]. She is content with knowing that she has entertained at least five people with her comical updates.

Mike White is still awesome.

The end.
