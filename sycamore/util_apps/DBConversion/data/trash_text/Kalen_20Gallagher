Kalen Gallagher is the current (from winter 2004 to winter 2005) ["ASUCD"] President.  He was elected to the office of President with a commanding 51.2% (2063) of the vote.  He belongs to the ["Student Focus"] ASUCD ["Slate" political party], is a confirmed member of local secret society ["Sword and Sandals"], and the founder of ["Davis Players Society"].  His dedication to the latter is such that in "about me" on Thefacebook.com he writes merely "DPS!!!!"  His dedication to the preceding is of course secret.

Kalen is originally from San Jose, California and attended Westmont High School.  An ambitious young man, he emailed all the then-current ASUCD ["Senate" senators] before arriving here for his ["Freshman" freshman] year.  When negotiating with ["Lee Weissman"] about running on Weissman's "Unite" slate that quarter, Gallagher allegedly informed him "''you can have me on your slate or not, but either way I am going to run and I am going to win''."

Gallagher subsequently served on Senate from 2001-02 (winning a seat his ["Freshman"] year), Vice President 03-04, and President 04-05.  So far the only time he has not been an ASUCD elected official was during the months between the end of his Fall quarter term and the winter election in which he was elected Vice President.

He is also believed to have invented campaigning via AIM, establishing several accounts every election compiled of every available screen name of students at UCD and mass messeging them.

He has the longest frequently changed and shout-out filled away messeges on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_Instant_Messenger AIM] of anyone ["KrisFricke" I] know (his AIM is kalengallagher), and he is [http://ucdavis.thefacebook.com/profile.php?id=3200724 abundant] on Thefacebook.com.

Kalen was also a ["Summer Advising"] for two years and a member of the ["Fraternity"] Sigma Phi Epsilon.
