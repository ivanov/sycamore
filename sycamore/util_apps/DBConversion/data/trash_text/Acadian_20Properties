Acadian runs an assortment of smaller properties in Davis. Check their website for a listing.

There was a California Aggie article about them in 2001 which talked about how bad they were. But we haven't heard anything lately.

An experience with Acadian properties:

"''They asked for a $1290 deposit on a two bedroom apartment and ended up witholding hundreds of dollars at the end of the term for illigitimate reasons.  After I had a lawyer contact them, they gave the money up.

The apartment was infested with cockroaches and after multiple complaints, Acadian repeated their stance that it is not their responsibility that my apartment (and everyone elses in the complex) has cockroaches or any other assortment of bugs.

The only reason that I, and two other people moved out of the complex was because of the ineptitude and greed of Acadian Properties.  Acadian is by far, the worst institution in Davis that I have ever dealt with, and in my opinion, needs to be shut down.''" - ["ChristopherMcKenzie"]

My experience with Acadian has been horrible.  They procrastinate on fixing luxury items such as roofs and front door locks, and are rude, too.  When we moved in to our Acadian-managed house, the washer didn't work--ok, not a huge deal, but then we discovered that we had mice.  They fixed the washer, but wouldn't take care of the mouse problem until after we turned in our move-in inspection form, but we couldn't turn in our move-in form until they performed routine maintenance that was supposed to have been completed before our move-in. While witing for other, less important, problems to be fixed, the mice chewed through the new water-supply to the washer, and the house flooded. Just dandy. --["SummerSong"]
