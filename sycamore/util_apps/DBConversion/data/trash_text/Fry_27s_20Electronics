Fry's is a toy store for geeks.  They sell much more than just electronics, though.  Each Fry's has a different theme and for a while, a couple of years ago, they kept getting bigger and bigger and BIGGER, with cafe's inside and all.  ["MarieHuynh"]'s relatives used to drop her off at one for hours at a time to wander around with no money to buy cool things.  That might help explain her a bit.  

Fry's may also be the most ghetto of all electronics stores as it is the most disorganized and has the worst [http://www.frys.com/ website].  Its supermarket-chain origins might explain this somewhat, and its relentlessly no-frills approach probably explains the rest of it.  

If Fry's is too mainstream and consumer oriented for your tastes, you might try ["HSC Electronics"].

''Fry's is the best place to buy electronics if you already know what you want. Geeks like me love it because the prices are low and the selection is usually pretty good, but ["RobRoy"] is right, the place is pretty ghetto. The Bay Area Fry's stores are mostly themed (Egyptian, Aztec), but the Sacramento Fry's used to be an Incredible Universe - Fry's didn't do anything to the place when they bought it, and the interior is just this cavernous half-warehoused interior space with fifty foot high ceilings. It's intimidating! - ["KenNeville"]''

''Is there a way to get there by public transit? -- ["KenBloom"]''
[[BR]]''YoloBus 42 to downtown ["Sacramento"] then either 11, 13 or 14 to the area.  I forget which exactly, but you're looking at 2-3 hrs each way.  Pack a lunch. -- ["TarZxf"] ''
