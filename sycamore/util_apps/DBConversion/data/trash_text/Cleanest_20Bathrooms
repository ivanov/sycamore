Because cleanliness is next to godliness... and you want to crap in a Holy place, don't you?

''Please also see ["Bathrooms"] for both town of Davis and UC Davis''

=Cleanest=
 * ["ARC"] - Go there while they are still new.  Sometimes there's music in the bathrooms.  The ones by the Ballroom on the north end are the best ones.
 * ["Academic Surge"] - Nice clean low traffic bathrooms.
 * ["Bainer Hall"] - Nice and clean in an engineering building of course...
 * ["Dutton Hall"] - I ate lunch off one of these toilets.
 * ["Kemper Hall"] - Leave it to engineers to leave things feeling sterile...
 * ["Kerr Hall"] - This is really the place to go if you're in ["Wellman Hall" Wellman] and you need to use the bathroom.  All the floors have excellent bathrooms because the building is filled with nuts.  But unless you're both male and female, you might have to go up or down a floor to use one.
 * ["Lower Freeborn Hall"] - This is the basement of ["Freeborn Hall" Freeborn], and there is a new bathroom near ["KDVS"] and ["The California Aggie"]. It's worth the walk down from the ["Memorial Union" MU].
 * ["Memorial Union" MU] - second floor and up.  Might have something to do with the offices of some people with power up there...
 * ["Physical Sciences Library"] - More sterile engineers...
 * ["Plant and Environmental Sciences Building"] - main bathrooms are nice, watch out for the unisex ones though.
 * ["EU III"] - and yet again the engineers keep it clean
 * ["Veihmeyer Hall"] - nice big old fashioned bathrooms
 * ["Genome Center"] - many laboratories are still empty. Restrooms are BRAND NEW!


=Decent=
 * ["Chemistry"]
 * ["Experimental College"]
 * ["Physics and Geology"]
 * ["Roessler Hall"]
 * ["Shields Library"]
 * ["Storer Hall"]
 * ["Wellman Hall"] - has plastic garbage bags over some toilets that, chances are, will never be fixed.  Comes with an eerie feeling at night. Most disgusting womens bathrooms.
 * ["Women's Center"]
 * ["Young Hall"] - Although not spectacularly clean, the women's bathroom is worth a visit for the little art gallery alone.

=Tourist-Trodden and SCARY=
 * ["Memorial Union" MU] first floor (both east and west)
   * The ["Coffee House"] has pretty bad bathrooms, but EXCELLENT vandalism in the men's bathrooms.  Sometimes entire conversations are carried out on the walls of the stalls.
 * ["MUGA"] - Recently renovated but still stinky and overused.
 * ["South Silo Bathroom" EVIL HAUNTED SOUTH SILO BATHROOM] beside the ["Craft Center"] ''There are holes in the walls of the mens room stalls so you can look into them!'' - ["TheRadish"]
 * ["The Silo"] - The men's bathroom on the first floor is pretty rank. The urinals smell like rancid piss and splash urine back at you. Don't go in with only shorts and sandals on. This bathroom gets a ton of use.  However, the women's room on the first floor isn't bad at all.  It is at about the same level as the women's on the top story.
 * Someone was ["Violent Crime" violently murdered] in an on-campus men's room in January 1985.  Current pool is at $6 for anyone who can discover which one (perhaps evil haunted restroom referenced above?)
