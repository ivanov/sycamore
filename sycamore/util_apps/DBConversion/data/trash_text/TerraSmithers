I sense many a wasted hour here. but, of course, isn't ["Procrastinating" procrastination] what i'm here for anyway? yes indeed.

==Favorites==

I love ["Bill the Bunny"]. You may recognize him from my [http://www.livejournal.com/users/livinsmall livejournal] user icon.

["Keith the Dog"] is pretty cool too. He lets me take pictures of him all the time.

Eating food at fancy restaurants makes me happy, especially ["Vegetarian Options" vegetarian] food. Yum yum.
  * Some of my favorite places to eat in Davis are ["Sam's Mediterranean" Sam's], ["2k Thai Food" 2k Thai], ["Nugget"], ["Osaka Sushi"], ["Delta of Venus" Delta], and ["El Mariachi"]. 

==Info==

I currently reside in ["North Davis"].

I'm a ["Grad Students" grad student] and I help teach 4th graders in ["West Sacramento"].
