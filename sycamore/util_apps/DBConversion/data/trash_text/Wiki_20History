The following is a timeline of the events relevant to the history of this wiki as a project.  It currently includes mostly technical information, and could certainly benefit from the addition of the development of the actual content.  For information on our server setup/other geeky things, see ["System Info"].

= Prehistoric Times =

[[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]]Before this wiki ever existed, at least several Davisites had thought about creating something akin to it.  For instance, in 2002, ["JaimeRaba" Jaime Raba] wanted to create a wiki devoted to Davis.  In early 2004, then housemates ["PhilipNeustrom" Philip Neustrom], ["PaulIvanov" Paul Ivanov], and ["MikeIvanov" Mike Ivanov] sat down over some tasty burritos at ["Guadalajara" the Guad] to discuss several ideas for implementing a freely accessible, freely editable, and extremely user-friendly website where useful and entertaining information about the city and the university could be collected.  The central concept was the ability for anyone to create an illustrated "entry" describing a place, event, person, or idea related to Davis, and make it possible for others to find and reference the entry in order to organize and build on the content.  In addition, an intuitive interface built around a geographic map of the city was discussed.  Above all, emphasis was placed on usability and dynamic content.

||attachment:laptop.png [[BR]]''Davis Wiki running on Philip's laptop.''||<valign="top">[[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]]Deciding to jump right in rather than build the web site from the ground up, on June 24, 2004, ["PhilipNeustrom" Philip Neustrom] installed and configured a copy of the popular open-source wiki package [http://moin.sourceforge.net/ MoinMoin] on his laptop, an iBook G4.  He named it, naturally enough, "Davis Wiki," and chose the bike circle, a symbol especially recognizable in Davis, as a tentative logo (see ["Wiki Logo"]).  He created a few pages, including ["Davis Principles Of Community"], and opened up the wiki for contributions from friends (see ["User Statistics"] for dates users joined).[[BR]][[BR]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]]Although the MoinMoin wiki, generic as it was, did not exactly fit the original concept for the website, and although accessing it on Philip's laptop was far from convenient, it is fair to say that the potential was immediately felt by some of the early users.  On June 29 ["PhilipNeustrom" Philip] acquired temporary hosting courtesy of ["JoshuaGo"], and together with ["MikeIvanov" Mike] began the process of transforming the MoinMoin package into the vision of Davis Wiki.||

[[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]]On July 2, 2004, much to the surprise of ["PhilipNeustrom" Philip], ["MikeIvanov" Mike] registered the domain {{{www.daviswiki.org}}} and set it up to redirect to our temporary hosting.  Work was progressing on customizing the wiki and making it easier to use.  The top priority was designing a new theme that was more user-friendly and visually appealing than the default themes available in MoinMoin at the time.  At this point Mike did some initial proof-of-concept coding of the ["Davis Map" interactive map].

[[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]]On July 5, 2004, the wiki was put on permanent, reliable hosting.  Or so we thought at the time.  It would turn out to be neither reliable, nor, we hope, permanent.  Still, it was much better than what we had before, so there was much merriment.  During the summer Mike and Philip were involved in the mathematics VIGRE summer research program, but Davis Wiki was taking up more and more of their time.

[[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]]By late July, the new theme was nearly complete.  It looked almost nothing like the original theme and featured CSS tabs for intuitive navigation, a simplified login screen, and a unified search interface.  A MoinMoin developer even complimented us on the look of our wiki, and apparently liked it so much that the new [http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/ MoinMoin Wiki] now looks remarkably similar to our own.  In addition, Philip and Mike added many new features, such as the comment box, an XML-based ["Events Board"] complete with an ["Events Board Syndication" RSS feed].

[[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]]The development of the wiki slowed down somewhat over the next two months, partly to allow for some rest, and partly because school started in late September.  Nevertheless, the content grew steadily and more users joined every week.  The one major development in August was the move away from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase CamelCase], which allowed for more natural page names.

= Going Public =

[[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]]The start of the 2004-05 school year was always the target for "going public" with the website.  This meant finalizing all the interface tweaks, testing the features, and removing the password protection in order to allow anyone to view and join the wiki.  As a purely historical note, our password used to be "bikecircle69".

[[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]]The wiki was not quite ready at the start of the school year, but it was close.  In the final push to make the wiki publically available, ["PhilipNeustrom" Philip] rehauled the search interface to implement powerful indexing software called [http://www.xapian.org Xapian], and ["MikeIvanov" Mike] rushed to complete the ["Davis Map" interactive map] Java applet.  After tying up some loose ends, the stage was set for the public release of DavisWiki.org.  We unlocked the site on October 27, created some nice ["Wiki Flyer" flyers] and posted them around town.

[[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]]Over the first three weeks of being open to the public, the number of Davis Wiki users quadrupled to over 100, and the number of pages doubled to over 600 pages.  The amount of content on existing pages had also grown considerably.
