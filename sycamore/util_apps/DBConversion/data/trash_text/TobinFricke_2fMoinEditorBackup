== Getting Started ==
First, check out the ["Davis Wiki Guide"].  This is the focal point for help and information on getting started with the wiki.

A Wiki is a linked set of pages that ''anybody can edit and contribute to''.  [http://www.wikipedia.org Wikipedia] is the prime example of a successful wiki project.  Also, check out [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhyWikiWorks ["Why Wiki Works"]] for some information on the philosophy of wiki.

After reading that stuff, and playing around in the ["Wiki Sand Box"], check out our ["FAQ"].

Feel free to make new pages -- just remember to link them.  Also, if you don't know where to start or don't have any ideas, check out ["To Do"].
