The Davis Period Fencing Club is a rapier fencing club at the University of California at Davis. 

Rather than using modern texts and techniques, the club works with 17th century fencing texts by the Italian masters and manuscripts that were brought from Spain and translated by our own beloved Mary Curtis. Though not officially affiliated with the SCA or Renaissance Faire, a number of members do fence with them.  Practice is held Wednesdays nights starting at 7:00 PM in the breezeway of Young Hall on campus.  Beginners and the public are always welcome.
