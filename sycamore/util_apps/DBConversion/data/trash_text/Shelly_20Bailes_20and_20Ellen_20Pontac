Shelly Bailes and Ellen Pontac have become the town "poster children" for gay rights.  The two women, who have lived in a committed relationship for more than 30 years and who raised a family in Davis, are at the forefront of the fight for gay rights in Davis, in California, and in the country.  

 * They worked to establish the Davis Civil Rights ordinance which elminated discrimination based on sexual orientation (the first such ordinance in the country)
 * They ran the No on 22 campaign (which banned gay marriage in California).  Yolo County was one of only 6 counties in the state to defeat that initiative.
 * They started FORGE ("For Gay Equality"), part of the rainbow coalition of the Human Rights commission at ["Davis Senior High School"]
 * They founded and continue to run ["Gay Pride Day"]

In addition to working for gay rights they are also activists in many Davis activities.

 * Shelly served on the ["Human Relations Commission"]
 * They usher at the ["Mondavi Center"]
 * They work to present forums for all elections.
 * Shelly volunteered at the ["Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence Center"]
 * They spent two years doing clinic defense at a local gynecology office, protecting women who were coming for abortions.
 * Both volunteer for ["Davis Community Meals"].  Shelly has served on the board, Ellen volunteers as a cook.
 * They are members of the ["The Co-Op" Davis Food Co-op]
 * Both help with the annual ["The Co-Op" Davis Food Co-op] annual ["Holiday Meal"], Ellen in charge of volunteers, Shelly in charge of fund-raising
 * Work with the ["LGBTRC"] on campus
 * They are regular participants at the ["Peace Vigil"] on the ["E Street Plaza"]

They were married in San Francisco in February of 2004 and experienced the pain of watching their marriage be invalidated six months later, at which time they staged a rally at the ["Yolo County"] Registrar's office.  Both are active as founders and heads of the local chapter of ["Marriage Equality California"].
