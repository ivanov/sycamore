= General Davis map information =

The city of Davis has maintained a rather extensive collection of useful and interesting maps over at their [http://www.cityofdavis.org/gis/ Geographic Information System] site.  The [http://www.cityofdavis.org/gis/library/ downloadable map layers] page is especially useful for the wiki.  You can download .zip files containing layer files, which you can view with [http://www.esri.com/software/arcexplorer/download4.html].  These files contain a lot of useful data.  For instance: the parks file contains the locations/shapes of all the parks, size of all the parks, and their names.

Among the most interesting are the 2003 aerial photos, which you can [http://www2.dcn.org/orgs/orthophotos/ download individually in high resolution] or [http://www.cityofdavis.org/gis/2003aerial browse seamlessly using flash].

The [http://www.cityofdavis.org/gis/unitrans Unitrans route map] is likely the most useful to students, though.

The city also has a [http://www.city.davis.ca.us/gis/bikemap.pdf bike map] available in PDF form. This map shows ["Bike Paths" bike paths] in addition to city streets.
