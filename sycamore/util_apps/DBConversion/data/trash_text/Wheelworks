  * This is the serious road bike place in Davis. Whether you want a good mid-range road bike, a serious racing bike, or a hardcore triathlon bike, this is the place. My experience here is mixed. Sometimes the people are quite friendly, and sometimes they're a bit aloof. If you are new to road biking and want a relaxed environment, this might not be a good first store. If you are more experienced, and know what you want, this place is just the ticket. - ["EricKlein"]
  
  * I found the staff very helpful when I was looking for bikes. - ["JackHaskel"]
