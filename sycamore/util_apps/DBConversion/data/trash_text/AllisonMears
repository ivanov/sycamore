I'm the queen of the geeks. Don't debate me with this.

I'm silly and enjoy silly things. I love the stuff that I grew up with, like The Little Mermaid and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

I read a lot, but not nearly as much as I used to.

I'm loud when I get excited. Deal with it.

I'm officially a Political Science major. But that's changing to a purely English major soon because I hate Political Science and I want to be finished with school ASAP. I like learning, but I hate having to prove that I've learned. The stress is bad for me.

I work a lot. Seriously. I work usually 30+ hours a week at In-N-Out Burger in Davis. The funny thing is that I love it and if I quit school and worked for them for the rest of my life, I would be completely comfortable and content with my decision. Except for that whole familial influence thing. They would hate it. If you ever want to see me there, I'm usually the girl who walks around looking like she's talking to herself, but I'm really talking to people on the drive thru speaker. Hahaha.

I'm dating an awesome guy, and it's almost 9 months. Yay.

I'm learning German and Spanish from a native speaking friend. It's fun!

Okay, I'm done with this procrastinatory exercise. I'll be back soon.

''2004-12-30 15:23:36'' [[nbsp]] I changed the INO number because the public isn't supposed to have the individual store numbers. They prefer to direct complaints, compliments and such there to the call center than hassling the managers, I think. --["AllisonMears"]
