Cruess Hall is the home of the Food Science Department. It includes several food science labs as well as the offices of the food science faculty. The most interesting part of Cruess Hall includes the pilot brewery which is in a big room full of shiny things. This room is visible from Regan Hall Circle.


Downstairs there is the Food Science Library which is a good ["Study Spots" place to study] (there is a ["Campus Staplers" stapler] in this room), as well as the food science ["Computer Labs" computer lab] where anyone can use the computers (login not required, but you but can not print).

Upstairs, you can find the Filper Room, where many FST TA's hold their office hours. When not occupied, this is another good place to study.

There is only one general purpose classroom in Cruess - Cruess 107. To get there, go to the South entrance.
