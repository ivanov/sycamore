For about ten bucks, lunch-time sushi buffet!  It's worth it to go occasionally if you like sushi and buffets.  But remember to get there at least half an hour or so before lunch, otherwise you'll have to wait in a heinously long line.

Also remember to use the bathroom before going there.  The single women's bathroom toilet isn't exactly stable.
