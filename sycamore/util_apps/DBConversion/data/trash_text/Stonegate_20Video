This is a small, family-owned video rental and espresso counter store.  They just recently added a U.S. postal office branch, which is extremely convenient for ["West Davis"] residents.  You can send packages cheaply, buy stamps, and do most regular post office business here (no P.O. boxes though).  

The video store is not giant, but they have an extensive collection of videos and DVDs.  They offer a Blockbuster-like deal where you can pay $21.00 a month and get unlimited rentals.  

The java bar has the typical espresso options, as well as italian sodas and iced drinks.  The family members who run the store are always very courteous and polite.  It's a convenient location for residents in the area who don't want to drive downtown for these services.
