According to Wikipedia.org, cow tipping is just an ["Urban Legends" urban legend] and is not actually physically feasible. Yes, I know, I'm as shocked as you are - I feel like my whole life has been a lie. Also I'd heard that cow tipping is specifically an expellable offense here at UC Davis, from a source I thought was reliable (maybe my official UC Davis tour as a prospective student four years ago?) - now I want to confirm whether or not this rule is true in light of the impossibility of its realisation. (I think I'm gonna email the chancellor on this) -Kris Fricke

It can be done.  I've seen it done once.  In Belle Glade or western Lake Worth in Florida.  It also involved a cow that was awake, heavy rope and a pickup truck.  It was done by a group of people specifically to prove that it can be done (they did it a few times).  The cow went over, got up pissed, and seemed unharmed.  I do not, however, recommend it. -- ["JabberWokky"]

Cow-tipping is widely considered uncool in this town. It is detrimental to the cows and to the humans involved. I think my very first night in the dorms as a freshman, someone asked the RA about how prevalent cow-tipping was here, and the gave them a firm admonishment. I have never heard of it happening or considered doing it since then.

''Student Affairs Vice Chancellor ["Judy Sakaki"] will be following up on this and will get back to you.  In the meantime, so far as I know there is no "cow tipping" policy or rule on campus.  At least I have not run across it during my twenty years here.  An ["Urban Legends" urban legend]...?'' -'''["Larry Vanderhoef"]'''[[BR]]
(I received the above in an email in December, 2004. Yes, I emailed the Chancellor about cow tipping. This is absolutely NOT a joke.) -["KrisFricke" KF]

I think Cow Tipping being an urban legend is an urban legend.  As for it being cause for expulsion at Davis, I hear so is believing that the word 'gulliable' is in the dictionary. - ["jonerikStorm"]
