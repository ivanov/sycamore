In the morning hours, you can also order a breakfast bagel made with eggs, cheese, and sausage.  

The Bagel area is also the home to a self-serve toaster oven, breakfast spreads such as butter and jam, and various munchies.  On the left side of the bagel counter is the giant case of Odwalla juices, as well as bottled soda, water, milk, and other beverages.

The bagel counter is open from the wee morning hours until the CoHo closes, but bagel selection dwindles considerably by the afternoon.

Once in awhile the MU Bagel Area will positively REEK with some godawful, burnt stench.  Has anyone figured out the cause of this smell?  

If you go to the bagel place enough, you'll either grow to love or hate the infamous..
  ''bag or plate?''
