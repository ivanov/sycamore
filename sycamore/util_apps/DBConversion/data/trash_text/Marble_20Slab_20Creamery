This place is a rip off of Coldstones Creamery, except that they serve the ice cream in plastic tumblers! They take cash only and have a sign on the door that directs you to the Bank of America ATM kiosk a few feet outside the door in the parking lot. 

 * The Banana ice cream shake is awesome.

''2004-12-07'' [[nbsp]] Marble Slab has been around longer than Coldstone, I think. That's what Marble Slab claims, anyway. The staff is always friendly there and seem to know a lot about ice cream. - ["KenNeville"]
