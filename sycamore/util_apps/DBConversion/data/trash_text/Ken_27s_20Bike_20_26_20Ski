The Ken's tagline is, "We're Serious About Your Fun." Well, I can tell you that we're definitely serious about ''our'' fun. That means we're all really in to the sports we sell. On the whole, I feel we're the most knowledgeable staff in Davis for the stuff we carry: bikes (road/mountain/town/whatever), skis and snowboards (and the appropriate winter accessories), hiking/backpacking equipment... It's a fun store to work in. We do have a lot of employees, so not everyone knows about ''everything'' we carry -- but everyone is pretty friendly and will get the right person to help you.

If you need to rent skis or snowboards, you should definitely give us a call. Renting on the hill is a pain. Adult ski and snowboard rentals are $29 plus tax for the first day, additional days half price. You pick up the equipment the afternoon before your first rental day and return it to us by 2PM after your last rental day.

''2004-12-06 18:18:17'' [[nbsp]] I've had really good luck here. I've shopped for both snowboard and bike stuff here, and as the man says, the staff has always been very friendly and very helpful. If I need to buy backpacking stuff, this is pretty much the place I do it in Davis. The only reason I didn't buy a bike or a board here is because the particular ones I was looking for were elsewhere, but both times I wished I could have given them my business. - ["EricKlein"]

''2004-12-07 12:49:53'' [[nbsp]] I bought my snowboard, bindings, and boots here three years ago and have gotten it waxed and tuned every year since. Good selection of equipment, just a bit lacking on the quantity womens jackets. Good service and friendly staff! - ["AshleyOrsaba"]
