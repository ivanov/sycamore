The ["ASUCD"] Environmental Policy and Planning Commission (EPPC) is one of the 7 legislative commissions under the ASUCD Senate. Like ["ECAC"] and ["GASC"], EPPC is a programmatic commission, that works to create a more environmentally sustainable campus.  EPPC also advises the ["Senate"] on any environmental legislation and policy ideas.

The EPPC meets every Tuesday from 7:30pm to 9:30pm in the Garrison Room on the 2nd floor of the ["Memorial Union"].

The current chair is Karly Kaufman.
