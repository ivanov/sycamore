Located at 1500 Shasta Drive, Adobe at Evergreen is yet another satellite property under the control of the ruthless ["Tandem Properties"] regime.  This overpriced facility is on the P/Q line next to the ["Highway 113" CA-113] and ["Sutter Hospital"].

Units come in 2, 3, or 4 bedroom configurations.  Upstairs units are carpeted in common areas with linoleum in the kitchen.  Downstairs units have tile in the common areas.  Each bedroom has its own bathroom.  The management is kind enough to supply a minifridge and microwave for every room (this incremental cost to them pales in comparison to the price you pay for such luxuries).  Other luxuries include parking ($25 per month per space), a pool, gym, vending machines, clubhouse, and a play area (for the wee ones).

Please note: There is a surveillance camera above the hot tub, so don't do anything too crazy in there.
