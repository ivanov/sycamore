'lo. I'm a Chem major.

Scurrilous rumormongers insist that I am, in fact, a political science major. They are not to be believed in any circumstance.

I'm on [http://www.wikipedia.org/ Wikipedia]. As someone.

I am not a fan of the semi-proportional ["Single Transferable Vote"] scheme used to elect the ASUCD ["Senate"]. I find it more than slightly unbelievable that 50% of Aggies prefer Student Focus to the opposition, and that LEAD and the independent are anywhere near equally popular.

I like elections, though.
