Local Davis businesses are quite generous in the number of FREE wireless hotspots that are made available.  This will probably continue as long as WiFi users continue to be decent customers.  It is important to avoid becoming someone who just hogs up space without buying anything in some reasonable interval.''

 ''For UC Davis Campus wireless (aka "Moobilenet"), you must have your wireless card [https://computingaccounts.ucdavis.edu registered] with UC Davis, and first sign on with your Kerberos password at wireless.ucdavis.edu before each use. If you use Linux on your laptop, it's easy enough to [http://www.lugod.org/mailinglists/archives/vox-tech/2004-12/msg00162.html automate] the process.''


Coverage maps for most of campus can be found on the [http://wireless.ucdavis.edu/Maps.htm campus wireless site].

You might be looking for ["Public Internet Terminals"].  If you have your laptop with you and wireless access won't work out, plugging into the ["Campus Ethernet"] might be a good idea.
