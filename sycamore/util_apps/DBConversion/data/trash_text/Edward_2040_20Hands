''This was one of the most amusing evenings I have had at 720.'' - ["DanMasiel"] 

Edward 40 Hands -- named after the movie, [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099487/ Edward Scissorhands] where the main character has scissors in place of hands -- is a ["Drinking games" drinking game] in which contestants duct tape ["forties"] to their hands. The forties can only be removed when the contestant finishes both forties. Having their hands duct taped to the forties forces the contestants to finish their beer before engaging in other activities such as peeing.

Contestants should bring their own forties rather than relying on ["free beer"]. After all, picking your very own awful, cheap forties is a part of the fun.

There is typically a winner -– the contestant who finishes his or her forties first, but rushing through the game is not recommended because 80oz is a lot of beer. The game can be played in a more friendly, safe manner, by encouraging just simple fun and no rush.



''I just wanted to thank Zebraun for showing me this game about two years back.  So many great nights have been had with Edward 40 Hands.   '' - ["LoganChampion"]
