'''Connections to Davis:''' Visited while on vacation to California in June 2004. Since Davis is known as a bicycle city, I wanted to check out the town. It is a very neat town and would be one of the places I consider living in if I had to live in California. The way the bike trails and lanes were set up in the town, it would be a good model for other cities to follow. In Colorado Springs where I live at, even though the outdoors are big here, unfortunately, the city is behind on getting good bike trails out especially trails that I favor which are separate from streets and roads.

Enjoyed doing business at Campus ["Cafe Roma"] especially surifing the Internet on wireless with my Apple iBook. A very eclectic place.
