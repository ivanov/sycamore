= The GRE Chemistry =
===sometime in early November ===
{{{He is currently trying to start thinking about actually doing the massive amount of
work required to get into a chemistry PhD program.

He was once a member of Canseco, and still occasionally writes songs that only he and
his lovely girlfriend Terra hear. He is a big fan of ["Pirate Ship"] shows.

He is editing this page becasue he doesn't want to start studying for the organic chemistry
section of the GRE Chemistry test. He never liked organic chemistry that much in the
first place and is dissapointed that there is essentially no quantum mechanics in the
test.}}}

= more of the same =
===11/15/04===
{{{He takes aforementioned test and now must wait for up to 6 weeks!
Relief comes in form of more procrastination. 

“In exactly one week (to the hour) I will be taking the GRE general test” he thinks to himself.
He makes the following rhyme in his head:

Oh let’s see, 
what should I do
Study the GRE,
or play halo 2}}}

= Mesoscopic Systems =
===11/18/04===
{{{His thoughts are consumed by visions of possible futures.
He finds it difficult to estimate the probability of any of these futures being realized.
Stress builds as further testing looms.
He recalls the thick fog from the night before.}}}

= Burgundy Rock =
===12/02/04===
{{{He recently bought a fender telecaster and is quite excited about it. It has been a while
since he has seriously rocked. The anniversary of his last public performance is approaching
quickly. He cannot wait for 2005. 2004 did not treat him well, and 5 is one of his favorite
numbers. He just asked for his third letter of recommendation for graduate school,
only applications remain.}}}

= Invasion of the enigmoids =
===12/14/04===
{{{He ate burned and disgusting pizza at the coffee house. He talked with people about haircuts
and other interesting things. When he left he was confronted by something even more horrifying
than the burnt pizza he had just ingested. Though small, the creature fired off confusing and 
vaguely offensive comments at rapid speed.

''2004-12-04 17:05:52'' [[nbsp]] stop treating this website like live journal.  you don't need to pollute these pages with your daily thoughts and whims.  - ["MikeyBurke"]
------
''2004-12-06 19:50:21'' [[nbsp]] You invented the word Hoopie right? I'm going to delete it soon if you can't provide some backing.  :\ - ["JackHaskel"]------
''2004-12-06 20:43:54'' [[nbsp]] I actually did not invent the word. I don't remember who I first heard it from, but I don't think it's neccesary to go around deleting things because you don't like them or they have no "backing". On those very grounds I could delete your comments about thai resturants, but I choose not to out of respect for your right to edit the wiki. Delete what you feel needs deleting but do not take such steps lightly or think that they will be met with approval. - ["DanMasiel"]------
------
''2004-12-06 21:01:35'' [[nbsp]] I think hoopie should stay but the "there are no hippies in davis" line is probably incorrect.  The page could be respectively reworked, like anything :) - ["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2004-12-06 21:08:05'' [[nbsp]] Sorry if you took offense. The internet is a powerfull thing, one that should be respected. Someone COULD just go ahead and invent  something. It might be something trivial like a Hoopie or something more important. I think that it'd be good form to make sure that people don't use the wiki to invent things on their whims. What if we started rewritting history? That'd be bad. Subjective opinions aren't taken as fact so it'd be wrong to delete them. We probably need a "wiki ethics" page or something. - ["JackHaskel"]------
''2004-12-06 21:16:22'' [[nbsp]] I only accused you because you created the pages. I asked numerous people that are hippies, hoopies or coopies whether they had heard of it. No one had.  - ["JackHaskel"]
------
''2004-12-09 15:30:14'' [[nbsp]] The ["Wiki Ethics"] page has been created. Feel free to erase all this stuff if you want to. - ["JackHaskel"]------
''2004-12-09 17:13:09'' [[nbsp]] It can stay - ["DanMasiel"]
------
''2004-12-21 17:17:42'' [[nbsp]] Whoa you changed "comments" to "dialogue," truly you control the arcane magick of wiki.  Anyway I didn't understant the "grains of salt" reference in the Apartheid conversation and decided I had to know..? - ["KrisFricke"]------
''2004-12-21 20:01:39'' [[nbsp]] Oh, sorry my little emote indicators didn't show up right. I just meant that rob's statement should be taken with a grain of salt (i.e. his informal comment should be taken lightly) - ["DanMasiel"]

''2005-01-17 22:25:39'' [[nbsp]] I wanted to ask about getting a sexy chalk-screen thing, as well as WEF status.  IM me if you have AIM. --["PhilipNeustrom"]
