'''As of 1/5/04, Gardenia's is closed for renovations. It appears they have been bought out.'''

Gardenia's used to be called Rosita's Cocina.  Perhaps the location is cursed, but it was rarely crowded--and perhaps is even less crowded now as Gardenia's.  The Mexican Food is decent, although somewhat pricey during dinner.  However lunchtime specials can be gotten for about $5.  There are fewer salsas than there used to be as Rosita's.  (For the best selection of Salsas in town visit either ["Dos Coyotes"] or ["El Mariachi"].)  

["JaimeRaba" jr]: Rosita's also has a dance club at night, but nobody I know has ever gone.  Any comments/info?
