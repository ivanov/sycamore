The Davis Peet's shares space with ["Noah's Bagels"] making it a popular haunt of the ["Davis Elite"], and rightly so as they very well may sell the best coffee and tea in Davis. Founded by Alfred Peet in Berkeley in 1966, Peet's has long served the ["Bay Area"] and has since branched out across California and the United States. Peet's serves excellent coffee and espresso, but does not server many sugary specialty drinks. If you're in search of an excellent cup of coffee, be sure to ask about the coffee of the day. However, if you're looking for a lukewarm cup of mostly milk and sugar, I would suggest ["Starbucks"].

''I'll second the statement that, if you want actual coffee, this is one of the best places to go.  If you like lightly coffee flavored milkshakes, this isn't your cup of... tea?  Speaking of which, they have Earl Grey with extra bergamot, a quite heady tea.'' -- ["JabberWokky"]
