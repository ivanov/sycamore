The most popular (recreational) drug in Davis is ["Alcohol"].  ["Weed"] is also pretty popular, and we've got our share of ["Potheads"].  Hard drugs such as Cocaine (we call thems folks Coke heads) and Methamphetamine (consumed by ["Tweakers"]) are less popular but also used by locals and students.

To cut down on ["Alcohol"] consumption at ["UC Davis"], the University started the ["0 - 3 at UCD"] campaign, which is arguably the most visible anti-drug effort on ["Campus"]

["The California Aggie"] published a [http://www.californiaaggie.com/article/?id=7130 drug dealer exposé] (01/25/05) that chronicled the life of several student drug dealers.
