One of the more malevolent of Davis' ["Town Characters"], Joe is a somewhat-underfed-looking guy constantly walking around town. He is usually seen wearing a sweater and is famous for liking to play with young boys. He tries to join basketball games being played at ["Davis Senior High School" Davis High School] and middle schools. The band ["The Knees Together Club"], who all went to ["Davis Senior High School" DHS], wrote a song called Crazy Joe Sherman.

He also occasionally preaches on the ["The Quad" quad]. The last four digits of his phone number spell out ''PRAY''.  Interestingly enough, he is apparently unwelcome at some religious gathering places due to having verbally abused people in the past.  (For note: these are not foo-foo betterthanyou groups, but awesome, open minded and student-friendly people that discuss interesting things, religious and otherwise.)   He's intolerant of even the smallest deviation from his interpretation of religious doctrine.  More-biased chroniclers would even call him bigoted.

He also likes to sit down at a ["Restaurants" restaurant] without buying anything and plug his laptop and cell phone charger into an outlet.  He's also done this at such places as the Davis Senior Citizens' Center.  Believes that this is a reasonable thing to do, under the delusion that the world owes him something.

He previously had a website, www.sold.nu which is now offline.  He also has a site on [http://www.angelfire.com/mac/resurrection/ angelfire] that has a nearly 100 page document (mostly with Bible quotes) discussing his view of Christianity.  He used to proselytize much more than he currently does and claims to have recently done whatever it takes to become a real estate agent.  He also seems to confuse a lot of people with ["BenDuax"], or so Ben Duax has claimed.  Since Ben Duax is only 18, this futher reinforces the indictments above.

Joe Sherman was actually parodied at a farewell party for former mayor Susie Boyd in August of 2004.  ["The Davis Enterprise"] reported that:
 ''[Boyd's] comments at Friday's farewell party were interrupted by "Mr. Herman," a skit character portrayed by Davis Senior Planner Bob Wolcott, whose performance was a spoof of the frequent contentious interactions between then-Mayor Boyd and local resident Joe Sherman.''
