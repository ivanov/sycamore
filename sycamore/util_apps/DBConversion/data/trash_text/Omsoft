Reputed to be the best DSL provider in Davis. See the entry in the ["LUGOD"] FAQ at [http://www.lugod.org/documents/faq/lugod-faq.html#DSLOPTIONS] for more info about DSL providers.

Note that the reasons cited are for fairly advanced use.  If you just want to surf, play games, share files, chat through IM or voice, any provider will work fine.  Omsoft's advantage lies in the fact that they give you a static IP, which basically lets you run a server (a web server, usually) over their connection a bit easier than otherwise.  They also include 10GB of usenet access per month from Giganews.

While their basic service is dynamic IP, just like everyone else's basic service, the basic static ip option is only $5 more per month. One reason for this recommendation, though, was that they had the fastest turnaround time to setup a new order. ''Is this still true?''
