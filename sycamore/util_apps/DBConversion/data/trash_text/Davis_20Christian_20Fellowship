'''D'''avis '''C'''hristian '''F'''ellowship is an on-campus ministry.  Basically DCF is a whole bunch of people coming together to worship the LORD of the Universe.  DCF is associated with both Davis Christian Assembly, an Assembly's of God church, and Chi Alpha which is a national christian organization.

There are large group meetings on fridays in Social Science 1100 at 7:30pm.  There are a number of smaller "Core Groups" that meet other nights of the week for more intimate fellowship.

If you're looking for a body of believers to belong to you should totally come check out DCF.
