||<^(>attachment:blackb.jpg||[[nbsp]]||<^(>[[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]]I'm Yawen, a second year psychology major/women & gender studies minor. I'm a layout artist for ["The California Aggie"] and was a DJ for ["KDVS"], as Reverb with the show name "Lost in Transmission". Therefore I'm a kind of design freak/music geek. It tends to be a good combination. I designed layouts for various things (was a tech editor for a literary magazine). I had also kept a journal of my past [http://www.livejournal.com/~deradio show playlists]. But of course I still listen to certain artists shunned by ["KDVS"] due to its MAINSTREAM influence. [[BR]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]]At the moment I have a slight obsession with JKS words and feminist poetry. I prefer horizontal instead of vertical pictures. I believe in textwrap and squeezing words into small spaces, but against misalignment and empty spaces. I love hot showers in the morning, but not wet hair in the cold. I refuse to believe in regret. How many times shall I make the same mistake?[[BR]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]][[nbsp]]I am addicted to ["LiveJournal"] and PHP scripts. I spend my time writing here: [http://shymuses.org shymuses.org] & [http://echoing.livejournal.com echoing.lj]. Contact me or something: yawen''@''shymuses.org||
