Haring 2205, located at the far West end of ["Haring Hall"] is probably the least comfortable lecture hall on campus. Built when students were significantly smaller than they are now, the seats in Haring are far too small for the average student. Wise students will arive early and get seats in the second to front row, granting themselves some leg room.
