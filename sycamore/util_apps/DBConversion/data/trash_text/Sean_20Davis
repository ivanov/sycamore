Sean Davis is a full time lecturer in the ["Computer Science"] department. He [[s(start)]]asks us to[[s(end)]] demands that we call him Sean.

= Biography =
Originally he studied Psychology and obtained his Bachelors degree in the subject.  Like anyone with only a Bachelors in Psychology, Sean found his options for employment limited.  He found work in the house painting industry of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Ramon San Ramon, California].  After painting houses for a number of years, the physical labor (and his knees going out) began to get to him.  He then decided to try out teaching at the (now defunct) ["Sacramento"] High School.  He then enrolled in his first ["Computer Science"] course at ["Sacramento State University"].  Later, he switched from the MA in ["Computer Science" CS] program at ["Sacramento State University" Sac State] to the PhD program in ["Computer Science" CS] at ["UC Davis"].  Sean was in the PhD program for a few years, and obtained his Masters degree, but never stayed on to complete his dissertation (and thus did not obtain a PhD).

While he was a student at ["UC Davis"], Sean spent 3 years living out of a VW bus parked in the ["Tercero"] parking lot.  He apparently lived there until he was kicked out by ["Transportation And Parking Services" TAPS] or some other authority figure.

= Teaching =

Due to his lack of his PhD we may call him Master Davis.  As a teacher, he's difficult, but you learn a lot from his classes. If you can't stand a class with Sean, you should probably leave the major.  But he is a very fun lecturer, in that he really gets in to what he is teaching and asks for lots of participation.

He also comes up with new assignments for every quarter so if you're thinking of copying from friends that have had his class before... don't.

''2004-12-16 13:19:46'' [[nbsp]] Although he has obviously been doing it for a long time, what I have seen of his programming(on assignments) has left me with the impression that it's not top-notch, but this can be because it was simply not his best effort. - ["MikeIvanov"]------
''2004-12-16 13:24:39'' [[nbsp]] This is true of many people in academia (I don't know Sean Davis, so I can't say anything about him specifically). That doesn't mean that they are bad teachers. Some of the best programmers I know are afwul teachers, and some really good teachers should never be allowed near production code. Go figure... - ["EricKlein"]------
''2004-12-16 13:33:27'' [[nbsp]] That's definitely true, but for many of his assignments, Sean prescribes the architecture in detail, based on how he structured his program, which to me personally often seemed illogical.  This is probably due to his own time constraints, etc.  But I suppose if you share my opinion, it does get you accustomed to deciphering terrible code in the industry. - ["MikeIvanov"]------

''2004-12-17 00:33:27'' [[nbsp]] Well, that would work well for the students who know what they're doing, but... a lot of students just don't have a clue. I TA'd for ECS 140A for a year, and there were a lot of students, even that far into the curriculum, who would have been really lost if they had to start from scratch. Of course... it would be nice if students who didn't know enough weren't allowed to progress that far in the first place, but that's another story. - ["EricKlein"]------

''2005-01-05 13:18:37'' [[nbsp]] I definitely disagree with this statement: "If you can't stand a class with Sean, you should probably leave the major." While if you don't have the ability to pass Sean's class you should probably leave the major is true... there is hardly a good reason for the amount of BS work he assigns. So if you can't stand his style, don't worry... take the class from someone else, almost definitely you'll have fewer assignments, most likely learn just as much, and still be able to be successful in CS. Though I criticize the workload of his classes, Sean is a good teacher, so don't fret too much if you don't have the luxury of taking the class from someone else. And in the off chance you actually like his style of work-overload you're in for a real treat --["JevanGray"]
