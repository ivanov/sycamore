The Craft Center is a place for artistically bent people to go and have some fun creating things.  They have labs for ceramics, photography, textiles, glass, wood, metal, etc.  It is open to the public, although student fees go to the Craft Center so students and employees get a discount on classes offered there and spouses/domestic partners get a lesser discount.

The Craft Center has a good number of interesting classes.  Most instructors are very nice and are willing to help out and give advice even if you're not in the class, although their focus is of course on their enrolled students.  It is a good idea to try to find the instructor and talk to him/her before signing up for a class to see what sorts of wonderful things you might get out of their class and you might find yourself interested in something you didn't even know existed.  A word of warning though, there is one guy that teaches photography who is somewhat condescending and sounds like he thinks he's better than anybody else, especially you.  

Those who do not want to take a class can also use the facilities by doing an orientation and buying a pass.  Passes are available for 1 day or a full quarter.  If you buy a bunch of day passes, they automatically get converted to a quarter pass. You can sign up online at [http://campusrecreation.ucdavis.edu/craftcenter/ the home page] around the beginning of the quarter, or go in person if you line up really early.

People that don't feel like paying the fees to use the Craft Center can volunteer.  Volunteers get perks such as discount/free classes(depending on how long you've been there), free use of the facilities, a free T-shirt, and discounts on the stuff sold there.  There is a meeting at the beginning of each quarter for people who wish to sign up. Alumni and staff can also volunteer at the CC to get those benefits. 

''Looking from the South (e.g. Bainer or the Hog barn relocation) toward the South Silo, this is where the Craft Center entrance is:''
