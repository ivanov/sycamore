Gilmore 5, the 5th floor of ["Gilmore Hall"] -- better known as the "Penthouse" -- is notoriously known for being a party floor in the dorms.  Every year, the succeeding class of freshman have to live up to their forefamilies.  Evidence is hidden in the time capsules inside the walls. Tradition is to have a keg on the floor once during the year and to capture every evil deed on camera and shove it all with other evidence into the time capsules. Other things include: bongs, pipes, underwear, DC plates and other fun stuff.

Most Gilmore folk tend to stick with Gilmore folk throughout their college careers.

Many of the current and past residents of ["720"] have lived in G5.

G5 is also known for getting hellishly hot during the warm summer months.
