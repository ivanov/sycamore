 * For anybody new to campus (["Freshmen"]), it is right by the north east edge of campus, by ["Social Sciences and Humanities Building" Soc Sci].  I made the mistake of thinking it was farther away and walked up and down 3rd street for a while.  - ["RohiniJasavala"]
 * Bring your checkbook or cash - the line for creditcards is usually at least twice as long at the beginning of each quarter.  - ["PaulIvanov"]
 * They are always very rude in there to students, I wish there was another place to buy course notes. The lady (or I should say "woman") in there stands there and says "next" while rapping her fingers on the counter, you step up and she yanks your ATM card out of your hands and swipes it and then yells "next" again and pushes you to the side while you are waiting for your reciept. Such a nice friendly place.... Or not. - ["AshleyOrsaba"]
