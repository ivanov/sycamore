''2004-12-06 23:04:13'' [[nbsp]] Women is an awesome book. But it is a blueprint on how not to treat a women more than it it is anything romantic. How any women put up with Bukowski I don't know. Oh wait, he got rich later in life. He dated co-dependent alcoholics, and wrote beautiful poetry. I guess i can see how now.  - ["RobRoy"]------
''2005-01-20 14:53:31'' [[nbsp]] I don't think I've ever been so intrigued and disgusted by the same man. Recently I haven't been able to get past "Women" while reading Bukowski's poetry. It's like some kind of tar clogging my mind. I just can't tell if it's composed of shit or some kind of truth. Any recommendations for poetry or other books? - ["LenaGranik"]------
''2005-01-20 01:03:20'' [[nbsp]] I love you! :) --["PaulIvanov"]------

''2005-01-20 15:07:03'' [[nbsp]] After reading Women I wondered how Bukowski ever got one. Thanks to Rob Roy for solving the mystery.   --["AmeliaCarlson"]------
