The H Street bike tunnel goes under the railroad tracks. The corrugated metal tunnel has two sloping entrances on H Street and a short winding path that opens onto J Street.

The J Street side.

Be warned that when travelling from J St to H St, the abrupt end of the tunnel at H St can lead to a bad accident if you're going too fast.  Be sure to slow down as you near the H St side terminus of the tunnel to prepare for the immediate 90 degree turn. The turn is not very forgiving. There is now a wide concave mirror at the T-intersection as you exit the tunnel- use it to view oncoming bikes/pedestrians!

Conversely, be careful when you "exit" H Street and go down the path towards the tunnel. Since it is essentially a blind T-intersection, you're not going to see who is in the tunnel, or about to leave the tunnel. 

Both of these warnings are especially true in the mornings between 7:30 and 9 a.m., and again from 2:00 to 3:30 p.m., as students going to and from Holmes Junior High to their homes in North Davis frequently use the underpass.
