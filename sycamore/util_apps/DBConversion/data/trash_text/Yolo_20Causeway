The Yolo Causeway is the stretch of the ["Interstate 80" 80] linking ["Davis"] and ["Sacramento"].  Sometimes referred to sarcastically as "The ''Fabulous'' Yolo Causeway" or "The Scenic Yolo Causeway."

Joking aside, the view over the rice fields is actually quite nice sometimes, and many people prefer to bike across rather than drive through the rush-hour traffic.  A slow drive down the access roads is also nice.

The Yolo Causeway is home to quite a few ["Bats" bats] as well as a large amount of other fauna.  On the south side, there are large rice paddies, and the north side has a long view of the railway.  To the west you can usually see the beginnings of the coastal range rising up on the horizon over Davis, while the downtown skyline of ["Sacramento"] lies to the east.

Much of the Causeway is part of the Vic Fazio Yolo Wildlife Area, of which the [http://www.yolobasin.org/ Yolo Basin Foundation] is a major member.  The California Department of Fish and Game maintains the 16,000 acre Yolo Wildlife Area, of which 25 square miles is the Vic Fazio Yolo Wildlife Area.  You can see the big sign as you head east on I-80.
