Basics:  ["Student Focus"] is alleged to have campaigned for the Fall 04' (["ASUCD"]) ["Senate"] election in the ["Dorms"]. This is seen as a serious problem to some as it means they were campaigning closely to polling places on election day, which is against elections regulations. Some of the accusations include claims that the candidates "helped" people vote. Senators Nafeh Malik and Sean Ruel resigned only one week after they were sworn in.

A [http://californiaaggie.com/article/?id=6559 letter to the editor] was also published alleging that Nafeh Malik participated in dorm campaigning, despite the fact he was on crutches.

Dec 2nd - The ["Senate"] meeting in which the new candidates were supposed to be sworn in turned into a three-hour-long public discussion about whether the candidates alleged to have campaigned in the dorms should be sworn in or not.  Because of the complaints filed against the ["Elections Committee"] in the ["Election Statement Controversy"], it would violate ASUCD bylaws to swear in new candidates while the complaint was being considered by ["Student Judicial Affairs" SJA].  The ["The California Aggie" Aggie] has a [http://www.californiaaggie.com/article/?id=6653 good article] covering the events of the senate meeting.  The Senate agreed to continue with business without swearing in new officers, as many senators felt that ASUCD was under attack. Most felt it would be a bad idea to suspend the bylaws to let accused cheaters take office, including the recently elected ["Janine Fiel"] of the ["LEAD"] slate who did not want to take office under the circumstances.  ["Dyanna Quizon"] in particular felt that campaigning in dorms was a sign of poor character, and denied ever taking place in any such activities.


Dec 7th - Aggie Articles:
  * The ["California Aggie"] published many [http://www.californiaaggie.com/article/?id=6676 letters to the editor], critical of ["Student Focus" Focus'] actions, at the dorms and in the Senate.  One letter says that candidates should have legal ways to campaign in the dorms and reach out to freshmen, but ["Internal Affairs Commission"] Chair ["Kahliah Laney"] had said at the previous Senate meeting that her efforts to get candidates in the dorms would be hampered by the current scandal.
  * Aggie Columnist ["Russ Fagaly"] wrote a [http://www.californiaaggie.com/article/?id=6674 column] calling for the recall of the Student Focus candidates and arguing that ASUCD is in the worst shape it ever has been.

Jan 13th:
  * Nafeh Malik and Sean Ruel [http://californiaaggie.com/article/?id=6967 resign] from the senate exactly one week after being sworn in.
