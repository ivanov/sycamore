There is the official seal of the University of California, which looks like this:

The Davis-specific seal looks like this:

The Class of 1999 was apparently nice enough to donate the University a big granite/marble? version of the seal, which is at the entrance to the ["Memorial Union"]. If one was to find one's self on top of the ["Memorial Union" MU], and one took a picture of this seal from above, and one rotated that picture 180 degrees so that the text is right side up, that picture might look something like this:

I believe ["UC Berkeley"] is the only UC to have their name written along the side of the seal, as in:
