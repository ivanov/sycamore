King Lounge is a slightly noiser version of ["Griffin Lounge"].  It is on the
second floor of the MU (go up there and wander; you'll find it).  It is a
little off the beaten path, but seems to have more character because of this.
In King Lounge, students can be seen studying, chating with friends, watching
tv and ["Sleeping On Campus"].
