Directly south of ["Kemper Hall"] lies a nondescript building that is actually home to many of the important servers used by students and faculty at UCD. This includes stuff like the email servers, myucdavis, and a bunch of other crap that people like ["ArlenAbraham"] or others would probably be more knowledgeable of than me. So they should update this page.

Also, they have a ping pong table inside.
