Tryte is Octavio F. Genera, Jose Antonio Cruz, Matthew Hagerty, and Mike Hagerty.  They have a [http://www.tryte.com website], with a ton of pictures and so forth.  (Someone into them should add more about them so we have more than just opinions)

= Opinions on Tryte =
This band fucking rocks. Very clean solid sound....good soulful jams...amazing lead guitarist...passionate vocals...good grooves all around... - ["MikeKayton"]

''This band may be good musicians but for the most part they suck. They can't even spell. Whatever happened to bro-music having testosterone? Anyways... besides ["Some Assholes"], Tryte has the most honest band name in Davis. This band is the local favorite for sorority sluts to suck dick to.
If you like Dave Mathews Band, but hate the blackness of it all, then you will like Tryte.'' - ["RobRoy"]

''Saw these guys at ["The Graduate" the Grad] during a battle of the bands not too long ago. Worst performance I've seen in a long time, considering these guys are supposed to be the best and brightest of the Davis scene... dark days indeed. Worst ten bucks I ever spent on cover.'' - ["KenNeville"]

CM Casey of ["The California Aggie"] sheds [http://californiaaggie.ucdavis.edu/article/?id=6295 some light] on why some people don't like Tryte, "Is Tryte the official band of the UC Davis sorority system? Tonight they bring their shred-tastic college rock to ["Davis Music Scene" DMS] in order to please the hordes of young women with Greek letters on their sweatshirts. Those who miss the straight-up bluegrass of the Mad Cow String Band might actually confuse the ["Coffee House" CoHo] for Thursday nights at the ["Cantina del Cabo" Cantina]."
