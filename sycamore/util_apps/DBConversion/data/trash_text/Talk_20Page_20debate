''This discussion was moved from ["To Do"]''

I think there should be some mechanism for having conversations on a per-page basis.  Some kind of 'subchannel data' that's part of the page, but not displayed by default, wherein we hash out philosophical differences re: page content and such.  It should be easy to update, support threaded discussion, and not be displayed in the main entry unless the user requests it.
  * I agree, this sort of thing would keep the wiki more or less objective and people could publish their personal oppinions in the subpage. -- ["ArlenAbraham"]
  * [http://en.wikipedia.org Wikipedia] does this.  They associate to each page another page called {{{Talk:thepage}}}.  The Talk page is a normal wiki page and is treated exactly as such.  The only difference is that it is logically paired to the page in question.  For Wikipedia, this is a really good idea.  Wikipedia tries to offer all viewpoints on all issues, hense on charged/potentially charged topics they can have discussion and not have it infringe on the content page (they also have the ability to easily lock the page when the debate gets too heated.)  However, I'm not sure that the Wikipedia style of content-discussion seperation is needed on Davis Wiki just yet.  It would be very easy to add but for practical and philosophical reasons I don't see a need yet.  We are not '''really''' trying to be neutral or an '''authority''' in the same sense wikipedia is -- we would like to have a bunch of accurate information and be a great resource, but the kind of strictness that follows Wikipedia would ruin a lot of what I hope we can have here.  You can browse Wikipedia forever without knowing it's a wiki, and that's what they want.  I'm not sure that's what we want at this point.  (As for having it easily updated and support threaded discussions, I think that would further fragment the wiki idea?  Or maybe not?) - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
  * I would agree with Philip on this.  Too much talking about what goes into a page can create the impression of too much structure, which can be intimidating.  I would much rather see all information about a particular item on the same page, including any discussions about the content itself.  In the future, I might support an initially hidden "Discussion" area on each page, but I see that happening naturally if and when this eases the wiki process.  Right now, I think it would do more harm than good.  On a slightly different note, I wonder if anyone has any creative ideas regarding a real-time forum for talking to wiki users, whether it be as simple as an AIM chat room or something more sophisticated.  - ["MikeIvanov"]
    * Real-time forum?  I think this is a bad idea.  If you're set on it, I'd make it an IRC channel and have a bot that tells you edits as they occurr. -- ["ChrisTakemura"]
      * I'd like to know why you think this is a bad idea.  I love your idea of automatic edit updates; however, I think besides you, me, and Philip, barely anyone uses IRC, and an AIM bot would work just as well. - ["MikeIvanov"]
    * Skepticism.  I think you're incorrect about the effect that these metapages would have -- They wouldn't contribute to an air of authority or strictness, but rather emphasize the wiki process, and ''encourage'' people to edit.  The wikipedia is authoritative, but that's not a consequence of the ability to have per-page discussions.  Now, it's currently possible to inline conversations, but that's a huge annoyance to the casual browser, and I'd really rather avoid it.  That's totally inelegant.

    And, just in case anyone out there is saying, 'we'll burn that bridge when we come to it,' there've already been several situations in which I might have added something to a conversation, if there were some way of doing so without polluting the actual entry.  One example is the EU][/Kemper/EUII issue.  I still feel the building should be filed under the former, and there's no easy way to access the decision-making process that led to it being where it is at present.  -- ["ChrisTakemura"]
      * I think this indicates the need for a survey of some sort to determine what the users will want.  The place Philip and I are coming from is one of making an impression on the people who don't know ''anything'' about what a wiki is.  So while we realize it may look ugly to have discussions interspersed(sp?) with content, I hope I'm not putting words in Philip's edit box when I say that we think this gets across the spirit of this wiki in a way that outweighs the value of the slick factor.  While I try to figure out what went wrong with the previous sentence, my point is it looks messy, but it's more obvious what's going on.  Again, I think we may want to poll the users about this.  - ["MikeIvanov"]
      * ''The wikipedia is authoritative, but that's not a consequence of the ability to have per-page discussions.''  No, but the per-page discussions allow wikipedia to hide a lot.  I don't think we're going for the same thing as wikipedia.  Wikipedia has a clear goal and strives for professionalism.  As per-IRC/bot matters, I am reminded of a funny quote: ''All cool projects have a cool IRC channel. All cool IRC channels have cool IRC bots. All cool IRC bots are hand coded. Spend all your time hand coding an IRC bot instead of working on the smegging project.'' (from [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HelpSourceForgeSuck Help Source Forge Suck]) - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
  
  * Compromise proposal:  why not make a new bullet that could be triggered by '''^'''.  You could have it decrease the font size by 2, and make it 80% grey and italics.  Rather than worry about fights over what is commentary and what isn't,  it could be used on a basis as seen fit, and basically voluntarily.  It would be good for anything someone signs their name to, for example. -["JaimeRaba" jr]

  * Didn't we invent {{{[[stop]]}}} for this purpose, so we can add talk pages to only those few controversial pages.
    * Yeah, per-page decisions, rather than every single page (e.g. wikipedia)
    * I kind of invented it on my own, and the admins made it a feature.  Currently, I like only having pages for subjects that need them.  Though it might be worth considering a Talk page for DPS, if they all feel like continuing.  It helps reverts not affect people's comments.  By the way, I like your icon better than wikipedia's icon. - ["BrentLaabs"]
