Chipotle is the quintessential white-man burrito joint of Davis.  They offer burritos (with or without a tortilla -- if you opt for a "burrito-bol") and tacos (soft or hard).  They make them in front of you and allow the choice of the following ingredients:  

 * With every buritto, you have the option of:
   * Black or Pinto Beans
   * Fajita veggies
   * Meat (or free Guacamole if you go meatless)
     * Barbacoa (shredded beef)
     * Chicken
     * Steak
     * Carnitas (Pork)
   * Salsa
     * Fresh Tomato
     * Tomatillo Green-Chili
     * Tomatillo Red-Chili
     * Roasted Chili-Corn
   * Sour Cream
   * Cheese
   * Guacamole (costs an additional $1.40 or free with a veggie item)
   * Romaine Lettuce

A soft taco order consists of three soft tacos.  Hard/crispy taco orders give you four crispy tacos.  You get more food with crispy tacos than soft tacos.  A taco order plays by the above rules, except that you don't get rice or beans.

If you show your ["Reg Card"] you get a free soda -- ask for a "student drink."  This amounts to a meal (large one) for just over $5. Davis has many Mexican restaurants available -- some of them better than Chipotle, some of them worse.  They add a touch of cilantro and lime to their rice -- very tasty.  If you prefer the rice over their (sometimes watery) beans, just ask for more rice and less beans.

McDonald's owns Chipotle.  See below.

== Authenticity Discussion ==

Too bad Chipotle is owned by McDonald's. They do help out ["KDVS"] every year with it fundraiser. And the food is okay. But if you use the word "Mexican" to describe it then you are in error. Chipotle is only half a shade browner than ["Taco Bell"]. - ["RobRoy"]
     * The funny thing is that many Chipotle employees and managers profess that Chipotle is NOT owned by McDonalds, but rather that McDonalds is a passive, minority investor.  Well, apparently (according to [http://www.shareholder.com/Common/Edgar/63908/1193125-04-35282/04-00.pdf McDonalds SEC Filing]), Chipotle is a wholly owned subsiderary of McDonalds.  So go in and test your counter-person about the relationship.  However, Chipotle was once an independent company, and ''apparently'' were purchased on some kind of condition it could continue to operate as it originally had, with its same leadership.  The latter part I somehow doubt.  But in their defense, they appear to have different food sources.  Chipotle appears to use a great deal of free range and organic products.  And while it's not Baja California-style, the inclusion of Carnitas and their selection of salsas convince me that it's ''significantly more'' authentic than drive-thru "Mexican."  To be sure, it's no Mexican taco shop.  (Not that any taco shops in Davis compare with those in Southern California and Baja California.  Certain Taco trucks found in Woodland and Winters are the closest thing around.) -["JaimeRaba" jr]
       * Two notes: 1) A friend had a relative visiting from Mexico (I think it was their mom, but I can't remember for sure), and after eating at Chipotle, they commented that the flavor of their carnitas was the closest they had tasted in the US to what they were used to at home. This isn't to say that Chipotle is really authentic food, but I think that they do get some of the details right. 2) The people who run the taco truck in ["Winters"] also own and run ["Chuy's Taqueria" Chuy's] in Winters, which probably has the best Mexican food I've had in the area. They are at least as good as most places I've been to in southern California. - ["EricKlein"]
       * The question "What is authentic?" comes to mind - mexican food in Mexico is not only a synthesis of various cultures throughout time (various cultures rising, spreading their tastes and then falling, with Spanish being the most recent) but also a regional and even individual tradition.  Walk into any town famous for a particular type of cuisine, and you can likely find two kitchens located on the same street, each claiming to make that type of cuisine "the right way".  In the end, it is not about "how brown" the company is (a distasteful and racist rule of thumb), but what they choose to call it.  If you think an ethnic food has to conform to some sort of rule, you're either European (who ''do'' have tasting and labeling laws) or have a very generic view of what a given ethnic food is.  I'd also like to see you sit down in a Barbeque joint in South Carolina along the Georgia border and complain that the Barbeque isn't authentic because the sauce is mustard based... or complain in Santa Maria that the tangy-sweet salsa based Barbeque (dating to the mid-1800s) isn't authentic. -- ["JabberWokky"]
       * The quest for authentic ethnic food is a noble one in this day and age of capitalistic homogenation.  Once the corporations get ahold of a a food category, they subvert it to be as palletable ("bland") as possible so people in the midwest will eat it.  It's not so much what IS authentic mexican-- reasonable minds can differ as to what be representative cuisine for a particular region in, say, Mexico given the ingredients available here.  However, what is worthwhile is to point out that certain restaurants masquerade as being "authentic" when they in fact are not.  Taco Bell--not that anyone believes them--is quite guilty of this.  Chipotle is an interesting hybrid.  On some signage they claim to be Mexican, and on others they claim "Mexican influenced," which is fare more true.  Despite their McDonalds association, they seem to have some surprisingly good and authentic food in some categories. -["JaimeRaba" jr]
