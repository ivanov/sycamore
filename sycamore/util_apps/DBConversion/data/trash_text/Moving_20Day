Moving Day is 08/31, the day that every lease in this town expires. Roughly half the student population moves. Every U-Haul is spoken for months in advance.  The roads fill with stuffed automobliles.  Sometimes mattresses fall off of cars.  Apartment complexes place giant dumpsters in the parking lot, which are summarily filled by moving students, desperate to lighten their loads.

To the dumpster divers, of course, it's like Christmas. 08/30 is Moving Day Eve. As one diver put it, "that's when Santa Claus comes around and fills the dumpsters with '''candy'''."

Class attendance drops by about a third during Moving Day week which usually happens in Summer Session II.

Some tips about moving day:  Check the giant dumpsters for finds like:
 * Lawn Chairs or wooden chairs
 * Cheap bike parts that you can fit onto your bike
 * Furniture that you can refinish or paint
 * Computers
 * Small appliances
 * Couches/stuffed chairs/dining tables
 * Clothing
 * Wall Art
 * Bed Frames
 * Dishes (wash them first!)
 * Free dead mice
 * Food
 * Beer

Those last two, of course, should be closely examined, and only kept if they're sealed and safe-looking.

Beware of sticky things or things with questionable stains!! Don't be ghetto, you don't want that.  Try for college-student-poor-chic-style rather than hobo-that-licks-rocks-style.

Do take second looks at things. ["RohiniJasavala"]'s apartment has no paid-for furniture.  The couch was off of somebody's porch (taken with permission), the chair was found at the dumpster, the entertainment center was donated by a friend that was moving.  

Beware not to always take the term ''["Dumpster Diving" dumpster diving]'' literally.  Look before you leap, and all that.  If it smells bad and there doesn't seem to be anything good, move on.

Paying for furniture is lame.  Using Moving day to its full potential is a good way to ["Living Cheaply" live cheaply].
