If you are serious about good food, Pedrick is the best damn place for fresh vegetables and fruits around.  This is the "real" farmer's market, where farmers sell their goods every day.  You can also find a good selection of hot sauces, every type of bean, rice and other grain you could want, and a wide variety of rural classics from chocolate bark to homemade peanut brittle.  First time you go, make sure to check out their ice cream.

If you like the coop's bulk items, many are available here for a much lower price, and you're still supporting small business.

It is on the north side of the freeway, at Pedrick road, visible as you approach, a giant Quonset hut (the metal buildings that look like a giant half buried tin can).  It can also be gotten to via back roads and apparantly on ["Bicycling" bike].


Pedrick Road is the same road the primate center is on, but in Solano County.  If I remember correctly, the bike paths run to the Primate Center, just head south from there to Pedrick Produce.
