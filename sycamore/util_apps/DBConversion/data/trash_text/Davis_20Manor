This small orange-colored ["Shopping Centers" shopping center] is located on East ["8th St."] next to ["Valley Oak Elementary School"]. 

There is large empty retail space where the old Ralph's Supermarket used to be. Ralph's Supermarket holds the lease on the property until 2011 and for reasons unkown it is an obstacle to development. The two largest remaining tenants (["R & R Thrift"] and ["Symposium"]) both own offsite property and are looking to move. The owner of ["Party and Vac"] would like to remain in its location and see the center revitalized. Proposals for the area include demolishing the center and created a mixed use residental area. There is exists contaminated ground under the center from a long gone gas station that would need to be cleaned up before housing could be built.
