[http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/titan/ Tabatha] is a Amorphophallus titanum, otherwise known as "Titan Arum" or "corpse flower".  She grows and blooms in the UC Davis ["Botanical Conservatory"] and is tended by curator Ernesto Sandoval.

Their single bloom is famed for both the smell (a festering rotting stink) and size (the last bloom was 60.5 inches, or over 5 feet).  Tabatha last bloomed on Aug. 13, 2004, the second bloom for UC Davis, drawing over 4,000 visitors to the Conservatory to view (and smell) her single flower.  The next blooms are expected in summer 2005.
