attachment:Nugget.jpg [[BR]]'''Covell Blvd. Store'''

The Nugget is a somewhat-upscale local grocery chain with stores in Davis, Vacaville, West Sacramento and Woodland. They also run ["Food 4 Less"].

The first time I walked into The Nugget, I was horrified and left immediately. I thought, "I will never be able to afford to shop at a grocery store that's this nice." While the Nugget may look nice, and offer a large variety of gourmet foods, they have a diverse enough selection so that shopping there can still be cost-effective. According to a study done by ["AmieGutierrez"]'s highschool class, The Nugget was actually often cheaper than Safeway or Albertsons.

In addition to groceries, the nugget also has a full deli, the best sandwiches this side of the tracks, and some mediocre chinese food and smoothies.  ["Chinese Food" Chinese food] is half-price after 8pm.

There is a second Nugget in El Macero shopping center.  The West Sacramento location is south of the freeway on Jefferson Blvd.

Don't touch the wheels of cheese. Yes, they are real, and yes, they will yell at you for touching them.  They even made me wash my hands.  
Don't mistake it for a casino becuase of the ostentacious architechture of the Nugget on Covell.

''I second that cheese wheel touching reccomendation. Those things are horribly greasy. The kind of grease that never comes off. I didn't get caught or nothin, but man, don't go around touchin no cheeses than ain't yours, ya hear?'' - ["ArlenAbraham" aa]

Have some olives.  They're delicious, and the employees don't mind a little grazing.  Pick up some cheap Chinese food after-hours.  Get pannini #2.
