The ASUCD Coffee House, or CoHo for short, is the largest student run "restaurant" in the United States. They do some ridiculous amount of transactions per day. The Coffee House offers (working from West to East) bagels, sandwiches, a salad bar, potatoes and Pho.  The Coffee House is a part of the larger ["Memorial Union"] structure.  For details on the bagel counter, please see ["MU Bagel Place"].

Going around the corner, you will find the CoHo Bakery which offers coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and of course, baked goods.

Continuing North, we find the Coffee House Too, which is the worst name ever so people either call it "The Grill" or just that-part-of-the-coffee-house-that-sells-burritos-and-stuff. That-part-of-the-coffee-house-that-sells-burritos-and-stuff sells burritos, quesadillas, tacos, nachos, pizza, crispadoras, bread sticks, breakfast burritos (if you get there early), as well as various items served from bins such as chilli, soup, casserole, soup, quiche, salads and pasta.

The Coffee House is home to a ["microwaves" microwave] you can use to heat your food up.  As the name would imply, the ASUCD Coffee House is run by ["ASUCD"] rather than ["Sodexho"].

The Coffee House serves not only as a central location for students to meet (it's hard to hang out in the CoHo and NOT see someone you know), but also a venue for the ["ASUCD Entertainment Council"]. While CoHo shows aren't what they used to be (Elvis Costello 02/08/78), Entertainment Council still manages to land a good number of bands such as Nada Surf.

In addition ["Davis Music Scene"] hosts their weekly shows featuring local and touring bands at the Coffee House regularly.

The Coffe House closed it's doors for one whole day in the Spring of 2002. This radical display was a move to strike against the ["ASUCD"] Senate's decision to enlist a full time chef, which would have taken the power from students. It is estimated that thousands of dollars were lost in that one day of closure. The following day former ASUCD President Chia-Saun Lai and the Coffee House reached an agreement. Out went the full time chef idea and the CoHo opened it's doors again.
