Amelia grew up in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz%2C_California Santa Cruz], and suddenly found herself a ["Davis"] resident on New Years Day 2003. Her reason for the move was ["Transfer Students" transfering] to ["Campus" UCD] from her local ["Community Colleges" community college]. She will be recieving her bachelor's degree soon, and plans to ["Stay In Davis" stay in Davis] for sometime after graduation.

She is currently employed by the ["Mondavi Center"] and ["Campus Safety"]. 

Amelia highly recommends watching the crows fly in at sunset.
She's been trying to whistle for 18 years now, and can finally impersonate a tea kettle. One of Amelia's favorite things about Davis is the ["Fog" fog].

She also thinks ["JevanGray" this guy] is the coolest thing since peanut butter & jelly sandwiches.
