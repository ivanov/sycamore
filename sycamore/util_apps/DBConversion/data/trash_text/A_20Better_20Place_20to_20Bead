A nice little bead shop with a very helpful staff.  The woman, who i assume owns it, is very nice and willing to show you easy methods and techniques for the specific jewelry that you're creating and they have a very wide selection and assortment of beads.  You can buy pre-strung pearls for $5 or strands of plain beads for less than $2.  They also sell all of the accessories to make keychains, earrings and other things.  A good place to make hand-made gifts or cheap costume jewlery. Also, they have a frequent buyer card that can save you $5.

They also sell their products in little ziploc bags that can be used for other purposes.
