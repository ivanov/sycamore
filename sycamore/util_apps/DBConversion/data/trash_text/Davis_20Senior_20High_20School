Davis Senior High School (usually referred to as DHS or Davis High) is one of two high schools (the other being  ["King High School"]) in the ["Davis Joint Unified School District"]. The 14th Street campus opened in 1961; the original high school now houses Davis City Hall. In 2003 the enrollment was at 1,958 depending on what source you consult. It was ranked 10th in the state of California for the year 2003. The school's predominantly white (68-70% of the student body) racial make-up has contributed to occasional racial incidents that are sometimes hotly debated in ["The Davis Enterprise"] but never seriously dealt with beyond politically-correct assemblies in the newly constructed gymnasium [the same for the old gym too!]. These incidents are also at times covered up almost entirely. Aside from the racial undercurrents at DHS, the school lays claim to an air of liberalism, supporting activities such as the ["Gay Straight Alliance"] and the Multi-Cultural Food Festival.

== Architecture ==

The Davis High campus is frequently under construction, as the original buildings/classrooms  are demolished and new ones are constructed. The new gymnasium opened in 2002, and two new buildings, including a performing arts center, are due for completion by the end of 2004. The campus' most striking architectural feature is the $4.1 million library/classroom building that was constructed in the late 1990s. [as long as they're going to tear down the original campus and cover up every blade of grass that ever existed, they might as well fix the "Icebox"! Brrr!]

== Statistics ==

The higest teacher salary at DHS is $66,676 a year and salaries begin at $32,614. The principal makes $91,624 a year and superintendent David J. Murphy rakes in $109,000. Every year an average of $6,127 is spent on each student. Students on average score a 1200 on the SAT, which may or may not be affected by the local Collegeboard™ scamming outpost, I mean standardized prep center, ["Kaplan"]. There is a 1.1% dropout rate at Davis High, but usually students who get sick of the school or have other reasons for not being able to attend choose ["Independent Study"] or ["King High School"]. 

== Performing Arts Center ==

The latest architectual project on the Davis High campus is the creation of two new buildings-- one which will be used for classroom space and the other which will serve as a new "state-of-the-art" performing arts center. Drama students had previously acted out plays in the Davis High-adjacent ["Veterans Memorial Building"] and Band students had performed concerts in the MPR, a small room with bad acoustics. Now both of those groups have a new facility to perform in.
