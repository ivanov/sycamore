= Transcendental Taste at Kathmandu Kitchen =

Although the decor inside Kathmandu Kitchen is not slick in feel, what with the aged, dusty cases holding Buddhist statues and the cart with empty chafing dishes that is visible to patrons from the waiting area, these are trivial details in relation to what really matters: ''the food''.

The food presents the diner with a wide array of choices, and there is something to delight everyone, from carnivore to the vegan. Also, for those who love South Asian dishes but are at constant intestinal war with heavily spiced foods, one can ask for any or all dishes to be prepared mildly. The prices are reasonable, not cheap, and even if you're new to South Asian cuisine you will have to work hard to make a misstep while ordering in this restaurant. Still, if you are worried the wait staff are good about suggesting tried-and-true dishes. Service is always courteous and unless there is a huge rush, prompt.

The author makes the following suggestions:

  1. If you have some samosas as one of your starters, try the Nepalese-style samosas instead of the usual samosas. The pieces will be smaller, but you will get more of them. Having more pieces is better if you're going as part of a group anyway.

  2. Unless you want to forego the dairy, have a ''["lassi"]'' to drink with your food. The cool of the yogurt will ease the spiciness of what you're eating. The mango ''["lassi"]'' is especially vibrant in taste, though more adventurous folks should try the salt ''lassi''.

  3. Kathmandu Kitchen has great sauces. Order some mango chutney to go with your dishes and your ''naan'' or ''chapati''. Ask for extra tamarind sauce or cilantro/mint sauce if you like.

  4. If you are at all interested in eating vegetarian- or vegan-style, this is definitely the place to do it. Many avowed meat-eaters will walk away from a vegetarian/vegan meal at Kathmandu Kitchen feeling nourished, full, and totally satisfied.

  5. Remember to take a spoonful of toasted fennel seeds from the bowl by the door as you're walking out. Crunching on a small handful of these little babies will freshen your breath, cleanse the palate, and leave a taste on your tongue that is out of this world. What a great way to round off a fabulous meal!

Kathmandu has a lunch all-you-can-eat buffet Monday-Friday that's a little over $6.  The buffet is more limited in choice, but is still absolutely delicious.  They also regularly have a booth serving up food at ["Picnic In The Park"].

 You're probably thinking of ["Fuji Chef"], which is across the street from Kathmandu.  They have all-you-can-eat sushi for lunch. --["MikeIvanov"]
