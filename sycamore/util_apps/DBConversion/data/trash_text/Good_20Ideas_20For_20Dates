You know the story: you finally get up the nerve to ask that special guy/girl out.  Elegant words are lost on you, but you manage to stammer out some kind of invitation... but now what?  Sometimes, asking isn't the hardest part of date planning.  Here are some good Davis-specific date ideas:

== Summer / Warm weather ==
 * Get ice cream at ["Ben & Jerry's"] and stroll through the ["Arboretum"].  Go to the back of the parking lot and you will see the ["Bike Paths" bike path] descend into the ["Arboretum" arboretum].
 * Stroll through ["The Green Belt"]
 * Try to catch a squirrel by the ["Bike tunnels" bike tunnel] behind ["Davis Commons"].
 * Suntan on the shores of the ["Rec Pool"].
 * Go to the driving range (there's two)
 * Picnic!
 * Drive 15min to old town ["Sacramento"] and walk on the pier by the river!
 * Ride bikes / drive to ["Stevenson Bridge"] (Russell W. 2mi to Rd.95A, turn left, 1mi) 
 * Bike to the ["Putah Creek" Putah Creek Reserve] (March/April) picnic/smooching. 1mi S. on Old Davis. Rd.
 * Go jogging; there are nice trails west of campus.
 * Try to ["Kite Flying" fly a kite].
 
== Winter / Cold weather ==
 * Navigate the annual [http://www.cornfieldmaze.com/sites.php?ID=&username=cawoodland corn maize] (aka maize maze) in ["Woodland"].
 * Get coffee at one of the many Davis coffee houses downtown and walk through the ["Arboretum"].  This may lead to snuggling.
 * Splash in mud puddles
 * Get 'tapas' appetizers at ["Chef's Market"], listen to jazz/flamenco - E St btwn 1&2nd Fri/Sat 6pm
 * Sneak out to ["Winters"] (15mi W.) for breakfast at the Putah Creek Cafe - served until noon on weekends.

== Anytime ==
 * Catch a movie at the commercial theatres in Davis: ["Movie Theaters" Signature Stadium 5] and ["Movie Theaters" Holiday Cinema 6]
 * See what's on at the ["Varsity Theatre"].
 * Go to ["Campus Cinema"] or ["Robotmedia"] or ["Alternative Film Club"] -- all are free or extremely cheap
 * Drive over to Sacramento and into one of the last remaining [http://www.fandango.com/theater.asp?distance=15&chain_id=CENT&theater_id=AACET Drive-In Theaters].
 * Bowling or playing pool in the ["MU Games Area"] is a good idea especially if you are on ["Campus"]. This is quite popular among freshmen.
 * Attend the [http://arteryart.com/Artabout.htm Second Friday ArtAbout] (occurs the 2nd Friday of every month)
 * Go to ["Rocknasium"] and get all sweaty with your date :)
 * Walk through the ["Farmers Market"] and pick out fresh food to cook (or BBQ it, if you're cookingly-challenged).  Then go back to your place and cook it.  Adding aphrodisiacs is optional.
 * Pick a wine together at ["Cost Plus World Market"] -- they have descriptions of what's in each wine.
 * Go to rummage sales and see who finds the most random object.  You can find a list of rummage sales in ["The Davis Enterprise"]. If you're really cheap, go ["Dumpster Diving"].
 * Set up a formal dining situation (think white tablecloth, linen napkins, bubbly cider and wine glasses) somewhere where it's out of place... Like ["In-N-Out"].
 * Spend your hard earned cash at a ["Trendy Restaurants" trendy restaurant].
 * ["Jusco"] - cheap sushi lunch buffet?
 * Play dinner bingo. Have a drink somewhere, have apetizer somewhere else on the same street and so on.
 * ["Davis Skate" Rollerblade] in the rain, in the cold, in the heat... anywhere, anytime. Try the ["Death Star"] at night.
 * Great ["Living Cheaply" cheap] date: On a Tuesday night, eat a $2 bowl of Tortilla Soup at ["El Mariachi"], have a ["Baskin Robbins" $1 scoop of ice cream] and then go to a ["Movie Theaters" $4 movie]. Later entertainment will surely be free ;)
 * If you both like to read/look at funky magazines, go to ["Newsbeat"] downtown.  See who can find the most random picture.
 * Go ["Geocaching"]
 * Spend a day painting ceramics at ["The Pottery Place"] in ["Mansion Square"].
 * Share a ["Super Burrito"] at ["Taqueria Guadalajara"].
 * Sneak onto an ["Amtrak"] train. Make love in the rest room while they collect tickets and then sit in the dining car and see how far you can go until they kick you off for not paying.
 *Go play racketball/basketball/anykind of game at the ["ARC"].
 *Run around town with a camera taking pictures for the wiki!

'''Be creative!'''
