The Health Sciences Library (also known as the HSL or the Loren D. Carlson Health Sciences Library) is located across La Rue Road off of Hutchison Drive in the ["Health Sciences Complex"].

 Parking is availible in Lot 54 and is also a stop for the ["Unitrans"] A line and the ["UC Davis Medical Center" UCDMC shuttle] which makes runs to the UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. 

Located within the HSL are the periodicals for the medical journals and monographs (books).  It is a great place to study since it is full of ["Grad Students"] and is really quiet.  Most of the resources here aren't available in the ["Shields Library"].
