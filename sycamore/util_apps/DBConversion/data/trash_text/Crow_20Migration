Midway through fall quarter there is a massive influx of '''crows'''.  Thousands upon thousands of these black devils come to roost, brood, and defecate upon the property and population of Davis.

Parking spaces, primarily along ["Russell"], are intensely coveted. Car owners hold on to these spots ferociously.  Consequently, you can see many cars completely covered in bird shit.  The absence of predators (coupled with an abundance of scavenges) allows the crows to rule the daytime Davis skies with impunity.

At night, what you think are crows may well be the local Davis ["Bats" bats]. The town is filled with lots of different types of ["Davis Wildlife"].
