Rob Roy is an integral part of Davis culture and lore.  He has been the manager of the ["Ben & Jerry's"] downtown for over five years, a DJ on ["KDVS"], and, well, he wears an impressive variety of hats.  But what makes the man a living legend are his insane shenanigans off the clock, not the least of which being drinking a urine/beer mixture and setting his pubes on fire on camera for a ["Robotmedia"] entry.  That, friends, is true immortality.

Rob Roy is extensively involved with promoting and booking local music.  Rob Roy has been a DJ on ["KDVS"] for a number of years, as well as the Underwriting Director for ["KDVS"] for the 2003-2004 school year.  Rob lives at the ["Pirate Ship"] and constantly brings touring and local acts there for ["House Show" house shows], making our weekends a little more exciting.  Because of his involvement with the local music scene and his nearly omnipotent prescence at various ["parties"], ["RobRoy" Rob Roy] is refered to as the ["Party King Of Davis" Party King of Davis].

Rob Roy is also an accomplished and active poet.  He was responsible for the creation of the (now-defunct) ["Write Club"].  You can find some of his poetry on the [http://www.writeclub.net official Write Club site].

Rob Roy is making a bid (Winter quarter 2005) for ASUCD ["Senate"] on the ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"] slate.  He is also a very active Davis Wiki user and has a ["RobRoy" user page] with somewhat more personalized content.

There is a pro-Rob Roy ["Rob Roy for Senate"] page that you might be looking for.
