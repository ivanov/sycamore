The Davis ["Toad Tunnel" Frog] Signs. These are seen from ["Interstate 80"] Westbound coming into Davis. They are done in a style like the Burma Shave signs that were prevalent during the Route 66 days (1930's to early 1960's). They were put up by a ["Lyon Real Estate"], a local ["Real Estate"] company, owned by 1977 graduate of ["UC Davis"] Mike Lyon. The signs are also seen from the ["Bike Paths" bike trail] that goes between ["Davis"] and ["Sacramento"] (also via County Road 32).  The signs seemingly glow and sparkle at ["Night Time" night].  The signs are the most visible display of the city's commitment to be a ["nuclear free zone"].

''2005-01-25 23:26:19'' [[nbsp]] all you see at night is the frog...it's creepy.  Nuclear free is an odd thing to advertise about a town...unless the town was near Chernobyl or something. --["RohiniJasavala"]
