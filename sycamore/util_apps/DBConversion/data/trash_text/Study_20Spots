This page is an evaluation of various places to study in Davis.  Some are places of business, and others are just good spots to study uninterrupted.  See also ["WiFi Hot Spots"], ["Night Time"] and ["Cafes"].

= Outdoors =
 * ["Arboretum Terrace"] - This is not the real ["Arboretum"].
     * This is probably one of the nicest outside places to study downtown. You don't have to buy anything from ["Borders"] but if you want some coffee it is there. - ["JackHaskel"]
 * ["Arboretum"] - The real thing. 
 * ["Amtrak Station"] - The train station has lots of very pleasant and comfortable benches. It is almost always empty so the only disturbance will come from the occasional extremely loud train passing by. 

= Indoors =
 * Food Science Library - located in ["Cruess Hall"]
 * Dorms LRC - even though you are supposed to have an access card, you can wait for someone to come out to get it! If you bring your laptop and an ethernet cable along, you'll have internet too!


= Cafes =
''Coffee shops tend to be more tollerant of studiers than restaurants.  The basic rule of thumb is to buy something once in a while, so you don't actually cost them customers while you merely hog space.''

=== The Good ===
 * ["Mishka's"] - They are the best of both worlds. They are tollerant and helpful to studiers, while at the same time freeing up some tables for casual coffee drinkers.  See ["Mishka's"] entry for a picture of their famous "The Rule."
 * ["Cafe Roma"] - Probably the most relaxed cafe in town (although ["Delta of Venus" Delta] is a close second).  Also probably the least likely place to have an employee tell you that you've not bought enough to justify your continued prensence.  Their two locations are probably the most run-down coffee shops, but not in an entirely bad way.
 * ["Chamonix"] - Open late, and very friendly to studiers who actually buy some things.
     * ["JaimeRaba" jr]: One time a gaggle of Med Students came in here and had a review session, and, much to the former owner's chagrin, the vast majority of them refused to buy anything at all, while tying up nearly the entire restaurant.  I mean, hell, tea isn't expensive.
     * ["JaimeRaba" jr]: Update:  New ownership could make this more problematic for studiers.  Several students have reported a poorer environment for studying.  They also note increasing prices, bad music, poorer coffee, and some unwanted attention from the counter (as well as extremely loud conversation).  Please comment to confirm or debunk.
     * ["MiriamDelirium" MiriamKaufman]: I used to work at Chamonix and I'm almost positive that the unwanted attention came from the owner who talks VERY loudly.  But he's only around in the afternoons, otherwise only one person works at a time, and it is extremely quiet.  The music is the owner's choice, a mix of frank sinatra, the amelie soundtrack, and a few french cds...there's not much they can do about it but they'll gladly turn the volume down if you ask.  Prices are fairly high for food, but regular coffee and espresso drinks are about the same as elsewhere I think. I don't really know about the quality of the coffee but I haven't heard any complaints.
 *["Study Parties"]- Getting together with a group of kids to just straight up study can totally increase your motivation (I didnt know where else to add this...I dunno, sorry).
=== The Ugly ===
 * ["Borders"] - Wow.  These guys are Nazis.  They literally only permit people to study for an hour, no matter how many things you buy.  They check your receipt.  And if you don't have one, they throw you out.  Wow.  
   * ["JaimeRaba" jr]: Yeah, I totally witnessed this manageresque lady with a total attitude mercilessly throwing studiers out of the coffee shop area.  The funny thing is the tables weren't even full and the people who aren't studying probably prefer to wander around the store anyway.  So when she was done, the cafe had absolutely no people in it.  Good job.  Border's handling of their studiers is so obscene, it could actually be fun to go there and cause trouble just for fun.  Anyone who has a fun Border's story (or a good idea for pissing off the mean borders lady) should leave a comment.
   * ["MarieHuynh"]: yeah, they say that they do it so that everyone gets a chance to use the space, but they still throw people out even when there are large numbers of seats open.  I asked if they had a comment box or any way to leave comments for the managers, but they said no.  FIdiots.
   * ["DanWillenbring"]: see my ["Borders"] experience: [http://omitted.net/article.php?story=20030910195839648] I have not returned since.

= Restaurants =

=== The Good ===
 * ["Orange Hut"] - 
  * One time I forgot when they opened and got there an hour early.  The guy let me in anyway and cleared a table for me so I could study there.  These guys are truly AWESOME. - ["MarieHuynh"]
 * ["Crepeville"] - Decent, although don't abuse this.  Word is that the management is increasingly frustrated with studiers who do nothing but order coffee and get free refills during peak times.  If we want to preserve this place as a place to study, actually having dinner would be a good idea.  And they have salads so huge, it takes about 2 hours to eat, anyway.


=== The Bad ===
 * ["IHOP"] - Not recommended.  It's much easier to get away with merely reading, than doing homework.  After about 5 coffee refils they get a little annoyed.  
 * ["Baker's Square"] -  Not recommended.  Again, reading goes over better than homework.  When they are slow, they're more tollerant of homework, however.
