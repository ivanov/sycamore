Fundamentally, a fistulated cow is a cow with a hole in it.

In 1822, a Canadian suffered a wound that refused to heal, but the man otherwise was in fine health.  His doctor discovered that the digestive process could be observed directly through the hole.  The discovery spread, and for over 150 years, fistulation has been used to observe digestive processes in living animals.

In modern days, scientists install a plastic device called a 'cannul' into the side or stomach of an animal which allows them access to the various organs.   In the case of the Davis fistulated cows, they observe how fast the cow digests various foods and what chemical/biological processes the food undergoes.
