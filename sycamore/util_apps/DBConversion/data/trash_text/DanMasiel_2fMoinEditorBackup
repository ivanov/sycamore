## backup of page "PhilipNeustrom:To Do" submitted 2005-01-31 20:08:50
This is my own simple little ["To Do"] so I can remember what I'm supposed to be doing.

= #1 Priority =
We've purchased a dedicated server, but it will be several days until it will be configured properly.  The new server is way fast and has a ton of room.

  * set dev content
  * simpleParse in wikiutil needs to use paul's thing

= Development =
  * Investigate Talk:Page pages for the overloaded page-centric discussions. (see ["Talk Page debate"])
  * Only show "Delete/Rename" when the user is allowed to delete/rename the viewed page.
  * ?: comments action needs to return footer in non-fork (not really a problem anymore?)
  * Returns in tables?  Support for this?  Would make markup look a lootttt better!
  * Special symbols such as "." and "?" need to be thrown out of the search (but kept in the re_needle)
  * Have all the backup pages gzip'ed.
  * search should return phrases partitioned if possible (any occurence if it makes sense)
  * Make a page tell you when it is an ["Orphaned Pages" orphan] -- Currently, many people create pages and do not link to them.  I'm thinking a little ('hey, i'm not linked to!' note somewhere to the right of the title)
    * The orphan page lists a bunch of pages that redirect to pages that ARE linked elsewhere.  This hampers orphan cleanup duties... Is there a way to '''not''' list a page on the orphan page if it redirects to a page that isn't orphaned? - ["Paul Lanzi" pl]
      * So you think that redirect pages should be excluded from the list?--["PhilipNeustrom"]
        * yes...?  Though I guess if a redirector page is listed on the orphan list, we could just delete that redirector, right?
          * I prefer having extra redirects around.  It helps one find articles more quickly, especially when using a feature like Firefox's quick searches. -- ["BrentLaabs"]
          * I like extra redirects.  Orphaned redirects are also sometimes linked from other websites.  Redirects are important and really shouldn't be deleted.. Anyway, yeah, I can filter them out when I re-write Wanted/Orphaned. --["PhilipNeustrom"]
  * ''Is there any way to fuzz up the title search? A search for "neville" finds me because I put my full name with spaces in my wiki entry. A search for "lawson" won't return ["AbbyLawson"], for example... maybe the title search is a tad too literal? :) Feel free to move this to the regular ["To Do"] or let me know and I'll do it, but that page seems to be headed on a fast train from organized list city to discussionville.'' - ["KenNeville"]
    * That's actually the way the indexer works in general.  It indexes words as independent entries, so YourName -> yourname (lowercase) -> a single word.  I might be able to change it to break up words based on capitalization, then make it all case-insensitive.  I'll do that during Winter break, for sure. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]

== Quick, easy things ==

== Soon.. ==
  *Meet Dan and Alex Park at 11am tommorow at 336 MU --["DanMasiel"]
  * Fix ["Wanted Pages"], ["Orphaned Pages"], ["Title Index"] to do some sort of cache.  Also, wanted and orphaned need to recognize a few more things.

== Parser improvements ==
  * {{{attachment:}}}, likely needs to be less strict.
  * when somebody links to an external image {{{[http://site.com/image.jpg]}}} it should do what it does now, but when they do {{{[http://site.com/image.jpg some text here]}}} it should show up as just a link.
  * integrate strike into page editor bar.  also allow for three {{{---X stuff X---}}} as well as {{{--X stuff X--}}}
    * ''If you could add strikethrough, we could use the wiki to interactively write bills for ["Senate"], or at least archive passed bills here.  I don't know if there is currently any implementation of strike, is there?'' - ["BrentLaabs"]
     * There is currently an implementation of strike through a macro.  It looks like this: {{{ [[s(start)]]this will be crossed out[[s(stop)]]. }}}  However, I suggest you wait until sometime next week when we are on the new server and many new features are added, like better strike formatting.  -- ["MikeIvanov"]
  * _this_ should underline (as __this does__ but who uses two of those things?)

== Open source efforts ==
 * Make source installable on any system easily.  ''(nearly completed)''
   * [X] Remove dependency on our installation "/home/dwiki" and all domain references, integrated into configuration files.
   * [ ] Document how to install the software.
 * Set up CVS
   * CVS is setup but I don't know how to properly integrate some of the utilities we're using.  Maybe we should just forget them for now.
= Wiki pages=
  * Populate the ["Events Board"] with stuff I find at ["Cafe Roma"], other places.
  * Add all the cool stuff I have that I haven't gotten around to adding,
  * Make my wiki page cooler and less boring :0)
  * Make ["University Construction"] better, updated, and filled to the brim with pictures.  I see the ["The California Aggie" Aggie] is flying with ". .an occasional feature highlighting construction projects on campus."  We can't let the have more information and pictures than us!  :P
