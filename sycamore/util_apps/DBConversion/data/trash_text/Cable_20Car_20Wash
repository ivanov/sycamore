$11 for inside/outside carwash.  Depending on the time of day, wait can be from 10 minutes to half an hour.  They also have a detailing area, but I don't know their prices.  Everytime you go for a car wash you get a coupon for a buck or two off your next wash (but it's within the next month, meaning you probably will end up giving it to a friend).  Only the cashier speaks English, so make sure you talk to him if you have specific concerns about washing your car.  Apparently [http://geotracker.swrcb.ca.gov/reports/luft.asp?global_id=T0611300226 they once had a leaking underground fuel tank].
