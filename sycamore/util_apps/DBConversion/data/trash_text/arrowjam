Pi Beta Phi's philanthropy event held during Winter Quarter in Freeborn Hall. 

It is kind of like airbands, and performances are judged based on dancing and creativity.

This is probably the most intense Greek philanthropy event all year, and members of the Greek community plan and practice for it well in advance. It sells out every year and many people almost take it TOO seriously. Last year Lambda Chi Alpha won first place for the fraternities, and Kappa Alpha Theta won for the sororities.
