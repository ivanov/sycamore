The campus Meat Lab sells a variety of high quality meats for fantastic prices. If you're planning on having a BBQ, or just need some meat, the Meat Lab is far superior to any other meat vendor in Davis, in terms of both quality and price. Unless you're looking for some specialty meat or fish in which case I would recommend the ["Nugget"].

Most of the meat comes from university livestock which is slaughtered on campus. However, the demand for some beef products is so high that some of it is imported.

The Meat Lab's prices change every so often and are available as a [http://animalscience.ucdavis.edu/events/Sale/Meat/MeatPrices.pdf PDF] on the [http://animalscience.ucdavis.edu/facilities/meatlab.htm Meat Lab's website.]

Recently, they've had a new flavor of sausage: Chips & Beer, which is delicious.
