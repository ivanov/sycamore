The Bargain Barn serves as UCD's clearinghouse for items that departments no longer need but deem too valuable to throw away. Items are first available to other departments, then to the general public.  Items older than 60 days can be bid on.

They sell a ton of stuff ranging from microscopes to computers to operating tables.  They have even sold old Unitrans busses.  A [http://ucdmm.ucdavis.edu/BargainBarn/barnsalesearch.cfm list of items] available to the public is on their [http://ucdmm.ucdavis.edu/BargainBarn/bargain_barn.html website].

The barn accepts cash, credit, and (for items under $200,) personal checks.  All items are "as is, where is."  Test it before paying, and be ready to haul it away.

*Just a note to those bargain hunters* Don't let the name fool you, this 'Barn' mainly has large surplus department supplies, i.e. ancient 1990s computers, filling cabinets and an array of obsolete electronics. If you want a fubsy sofa check out the other ["Thrift Stores"] in Davis.

If you want computer stuff, however, the barn can offer some amazing deals.  Often just on items that are obscure enough to sit for 60 days. When ["Computer Labs" campus computer labs] replace their machines large numbers of perfectly good machines go for sale through the Bargain Barn for excellent prices.
