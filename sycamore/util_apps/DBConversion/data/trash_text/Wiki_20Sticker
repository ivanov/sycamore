In order to get our name out even more, we propose printing an attractive sticker that can be put in windows of businesses, cars, homes.  With the funds raised so far through ["Donate" donations], we should be able to afford a reasonable amount of quality stickers in the near future (''note'': stickers are dangerously cheap -- about $20 for 200)

For ideas and graphics material, check out ["Wiki Flyer"].

 * I think small to medium clear vinyl stickers would be best.  That way they can go into windows without becoming an eyesore.
