= Introduction =

Sacramento, the state capital, is a bustling city located some 20 miles to the east of Davis. The city serves as an anchor to the greater Sacramento area which composes Sacramento, Placer, El Dorado, Sutter, Yolo and Yuba counties. The Sacramento River borders the city's western edge, separating it from ["West Sacramento"], a separate city in ["Yolo County"]. Sacramento has restaurants and bars in abundance, many of excellent quality.

= Student Body =
To no surprise, the UC Davis student body has a significant number of students from the Sacramento region.

Percentage of Student Body from Sacramento area counties: ([http://why.ucdavis.edu/facts_figures.cfm source])
  * Sacramento - 10.0%
  * Yolo - 4.0%
 

= Student Perceptions =

Many UC Davis students hail from the ["Bay Area"] or ["Southern California"]. As such, they disregard Sacramento as a true "city" but rather just a very large town surrounded by farms. However, certain native Sacramentians defend their region with equal zeal.

== Chinese Supermarkets ==

There is no Chinatown-like area in Sacramento, per se. However, there are a large number of Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants/markets in south Sacramento on Stockton Blvd. between Fruitridge Rd. and Florin Rd. A few of the markets (and there are a lot) are:

    * Wing Wa Supermarket (6021 Stockton Blvd. Sacramento, CA 95824)
    * Gold Star Supermarket (5815 Stockton Blvd. Sacramento, CA 95824)
    * Khan Hing Supermarket (6418 Stockton Blvd. Sacramento, CA 95824)
    * Shun Fat Supermarket (6930 65th St # 123. Sacramento, CA 95824)

Most of these are fairly old and are not the cleanest places to shop. However, Shun Fat is comparable to Ranch 99 or Lion and is located in an upscale (relatively speaking) shopping center on the corner of 65th and Stockton, across the street from Florin Mall. You'll find a TK Noodle, Lollicup, Goldilocks, and other Chinese shopping center staples there as well.
