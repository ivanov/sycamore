A bicycle is a two-wheeled rider-powered conveyance.  Most people in Davis find that their primary means of transportation about town is the bicycle, owing partially to Davis' flat topography and inadequate road system.

== Bike types: ==

Because Davis is considered the bicycle capital of America, it is naturally home to some interesting bicycles.

 * Target bike -- This bike is the most popular bike on campus because most students don't know much about bikes and just go to Target/Wal-mart/K-mart and pick up a hot pink Magna bike.  It's cheap and works "well enough."

 * Ghetto bike -- This bike has been in Davis for years and is cobbled together from duct tape.

 * Fixed gear -- Ridden by bicycle enthusiasts, this retro bike has no gears and no freewheel, meaning the pedals and the wheel cannot turn independently.  It's particularly suited to Davis, since the lack of hills makes the ability to shift gears less important.  Often not equipped with brakes, since it's possible (though bad for the knees) to stop by the agency of the pedals alone.

 Usually these are converted from old road bikes.  If you've got one of those, an alternative might be to see if your favorite ["Bicycling" bike shop] can convert it into a smooth-riding single-speed.

 * Fancy road bike -- Ridden by bicycle enthusiasts, these bikes cost upwards of thousands of dollars and weigh less than most students' backpacks during ["Finals" finals] week.  People who ride these bikes to campus are generally considered idiots.

 * Sane road bike -- Normally used, not fancy but practical.  You can purchase one at some used bike stores.  Costs around $100, more reliable than a Target bike, and is probably the best value for in-Davis biking.

 * Fancy mountain bike -- More common on ["Campus" campus] than the fancy road bike, this bike has no place on campus as the campus is flat and paved.  These bikes are popular targets for thieves.

 * Sane mountain bike -- A good option for commuting with a set of street tires instead of knobbies. 26" wheels are tough and quick. Mountain bikes will usually ride more upright than road bikes and can easily carry ["Freshman Stripe" fenders] and racks.

 * Recumbent bike -- You ride this sitting down.  Go figure.

 * Tandem bike -- Bike for two. Davis seems to have more people actually riding these things than I've seen anywhere else. NOTE: I once saw a tandem recumbent. That's GOT to be a conversation starter.

 * Cruiser -- Another good option for Davis' level terrain.  Heavy but reliable.  Usually single-speed.
 
 * ["Whimcycles"] -- These are crazy bikes created by the ["Davis Whimcycle Society"] and are featured at the ["Whole Earth Festival"] and ["Picnic Day"]

 * Mobile Home -- this is the kind of bike you can live in. There are two of these bikes in Davis. A man named ["Brian"] lives in one of the bikes and calls it the ["Human Powered Housing Project"]
  
Once you've got a bicycle, ["Bicycling" bicycling] everywhere in Davis will become a breeze. See ["Transportation"] for other forms of mobility.

I think the name of this page (esp. with "Bicycling") is sort of silly.  Perhaps this page should be renamed "Types of Bicycles" and then "Bicycles" should redirect to "Bicycling"? - ["PhilipNeustrom"]

 * oh, no.  This is, in fact, a page about bicycles.  The content happens to be skewed a little towards 'types of bicycles' at the moment.  I'll add some stuff on the top -- ["ChrisTakemura" ct]
