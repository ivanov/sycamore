-----
On October 21, 2003, during UC Davis ["Gay Pride Week"], the ["Davis College Republicans"] decided to come out as   conservatives. This was the creation of DCR members ["Jon Otero"] and ["Michael Dugas"]. They felt that conservatives were a repressed minority on college campuses and Gay Pride Week would be a good time to come out of the conservative closet.

The event held on ["The Quad" the quad] during lunch hour was met with hordes of protesters from several communities.  The ["LGBTRC"] had several signs; some read "Conservatives molest our children," and another had a picture of Hitler that read "Conservative like me." ["DanMasiel" Dan Masiel], ["GonzaloEyzaguirre" Gonzalo Eyzaguirre], Will Kaufman, and Claire Bolding created ''the Nuclear Phallus on Neo-Conservative Justice'' (a seven foot tall red white and blue penis with a nuclear warhead) specifically for this joyous celebration of crass patriarchy. The ["Ku Klux Klown"] was out in full force burning flags and hopping on his po-go stick. 

Months later The Daily Show on Comedy Central would have a segment on the ridiculousness of the event. UCD students ["George Andrews"] of the ["Davis College Republicans" DCR] and Aldrich Tan of the ["LGBTRC"] were featured in the segment. Due to the widespread media that this “tongue-in-cheek” event created, other College Republican/Conservative Clubs around the United States held similar rallies to “come out” as conservatives. UC Davis can proudly say that it was the pioneer in conservative coming-out epidemic.
