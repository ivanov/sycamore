Eventually, I'll put something meaningful here... maybe.

== Until then... ==
I've been living in the fine borough of Davis for nearly 2 years now. I attended college at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington.  Afterwords, I wandered around Europe for a few months before relocating to the flatlands known as the Central Valley. I recently conformed to the City ordinance requiring that every citizen have a bicycle.  I helps me pretend I'm active and in shape. 

==== While I'm not working in Sactown, I try to... ====
 * go hiking and camping
 * listen to live music (the kind with real instruments, preferably)
 * take photographs (see above)
 * collect (and occasionally listen to) music
 * feed my cat Molly (who thinks she's a human)
 * cook food (and usually eat it)
 * figure out why Davis has such a lame ["Bars" Bar] scene

At some point, I may attempt to elaborate on some of these.  For now, I'm pretty illiterate at this whole thing, so I'm going to call it good.
