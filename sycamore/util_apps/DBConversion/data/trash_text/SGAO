The Student Government Advising Office (SGAO) was mainly run by ["Vicki Swett"] (recently retired) in the office adjacent.  The girls and guy that work in this office take care of all paperwork, copying and sorting for ["ASUCD"]. You can find all public records regarding past elections, senate office hours, minutes, and legislation here in SGAO.

To give you an idea of who these people are, the sign on the door has all their names associated with Disney Princesses.

(SOMEONE TAKE A PICTURE AND PUT IT HERE).

Strangely, many of the SGAO employees are on the ["Elections Committee"].
