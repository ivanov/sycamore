Davis Wiki has a ["KDVS PSA" public service announcement] airing on ["KDVS"].

= Current PSA =
The following PSA was recorded by ["RobRoy" Rob Roy] in January using ["Legubitron"]'s "Johnny Ruthless" as the background music.  It should be added into rotation very soon.

''Is it okay to say it "wicky"?'' - ["KenjiYamada"]
  * That's my vote on how to say it. - ["JackHaskel"]
''I've heard it both ways.'' - ["JaimeRaba" jr]
  * ["MikeIvanov" Mike] and I say "wicky" because we think "wee-kee" is more non-English sounding - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
  * Yeah, ''wee-kee'' sounds kind of dorky, even though it's more correct. - ["MikeIvanov"]
  * One thing that ["KDVS"] is very particular about (because it is the law) is not having "calls to action" in PSAs.  So be careful when writing a PSA to be very indirect yet informative. You aren't allowed to "sell" someone on the wiki only inform them about the wiki.
    * So is the revolutionary language bad?  How would you rephrase it?
