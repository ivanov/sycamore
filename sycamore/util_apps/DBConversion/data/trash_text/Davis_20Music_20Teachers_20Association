As evident from its name, the DMTA is an organization of local music teachers. It holds semi-annual student recitals, periodic master classes, and teacher get-togethers. Members also get to advertise their services on the DMTA [http://www.dcn.davis.ca.us/~dmta/homepage.html website] and on the list at ["Watermelon Music"]. Membership costs $15 annually.

If you are looking for a music teacher, this is a good place to start.
