All Things Right And Relevant is a large thrift store in Davis where all profits go towards funding mental health programs in Yolo County. It's actually a couple of different stores, including a consignment store and a general thrift store (["R & R Thrift"]). It has a novel pricing system where every tag has three prices each associated with a date range. The longer an item sits on the shelf, the cheaper it is. 

'''From one of the founders of the shop''':

''All Things Right and Relevant is an upscale consignment shop (or at least it was when I ran it...I've not been in for quite some time), but we were pretty picky about the merchandise then. It is run by volunteers, so it is a great way for people to make a contribution to the community. They stock furniture, collectables, as well as clothing for men, women and children. The
thrift store is two doors away. Things that have worn out their welcome at the consignment shop are sent to ["R & R Thrift"] at the end of the consignment period...or things that aren't quite up to consignment shop quality. It is operated by mental health clients.''
