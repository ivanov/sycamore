Allegre has two, three, and four bedroom units, as well as an acute accent on the first "e". They all have a dishwasher, washer and dryer, a microwave, loft, DSL Internet Access Available, walk-in closets, private balconies and patios. There is an exercise room (which kinda sucks), a pool and spa, basketball court, playgrounds, and covered bike racks. 

What is neat is the ["South Davis Bike Path"] that runs behind the apartments that eventually connects to the ["Arboretum"]. This is very useful when you miss the bus, since it is about a ten minute bike ride to ["Campus"]. It is much better than riding the overpass, since you dont have to worry about being smushed by the bus you just missed. It is little known that when taken the ''other way'', the bike path leads to a maze of Escheresque bike paths that will literally take you anywhere in southeast Davis.

Despite the management's adding an accent to the first "e" (presumably out of a concern that people will mispronounce the name of the complex) no one is entirely sure exactly how "Allégre" is pronounced.
