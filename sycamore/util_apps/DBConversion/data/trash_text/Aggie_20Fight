The Fight Song of the University of California at Davis.
Most students (At least those who aren't in the ["Aggie Band"]) have no idea what the lyrics to it are.

"Lift up your voices, now's the time to sing. This is[[BR]]
the day the victory bell will ring. Loyal Aggies,[[BR]]
all for one. Never stopping 'til we've won, Because[[BR]]
the Mustang will show our Teams the way to fight,[[BR]]
Charging the enemy with all his might. Let's go.[[BR]]
Let's win. Today's the day The Aggies will fight![[BR]]
Fight! Fight!"
