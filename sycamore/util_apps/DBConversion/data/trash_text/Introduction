Anyone can edit the wiki.  Anyone can contribute, change, and add.  Most websites you go to are static -- you only read them.  This is a very different place.

What we are aiming for is a place to record Davis culture, places, spots -- everything!  This is an experiment in community and a project that can be fruitful for years to come to both old and new in Davis.

Everyone these days has their own personal blog.  They write down everyday activities, things they do, places they go.  But how about the city itself?  Imagine this as sort of a "blog" for Davis itself.  A place for sharing, listening, and exploring. 

So, go grab your camera and find something!  Write a review of your favorite place.  Tell us about a nice thing to do on Tuesdays.  Give us a picture of your street.  The topics and room for exploration is endless, and we will hopefully record a little bit of what Davis means for us, here.

What the wiki contains and means is up to ''you''.  As a general rule you should contribute content you think will be helpful or insightful to others, but even this rule can be broken at times.  Interesting things will stay, and bad contributions will pass with time.  Never be afraid to try something new, to edit something, to make your voice heard.

This is our place, our resource, and our voice.
