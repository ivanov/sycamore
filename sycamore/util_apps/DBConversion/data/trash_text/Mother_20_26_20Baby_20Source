This is a wonderful place to get a unique gift or pick up those harder to find mother and baby products.  If you're looking for standard items like child proofing devices you should check out some place like ["ACE Hardware" Davis Lumber].

The store is inviting with a couch and baby changing table.  And the store owner, Lori Rumsey, is a kick to have a conversation with!
