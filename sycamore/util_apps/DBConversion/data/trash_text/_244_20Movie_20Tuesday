Every Tuesday both ["Movie Theaters" Signature Davis Stadium 5] and ["Movie Theaters" Signature Davis Holiday 6] show select ["Movies" movies] for the fantastic price of $4 all day (no student or matinee discount on top of that).  Recently released movies (within the first two weeks of their release) don't qualify, and every so often there are no $4 movies available.  The selection also changes weekely, so it's best to call ahead.

The $4 Tuesday selection can be found by calling Stadium 5:
