The McKeon Condominiums are in a circular layout next to the Wildhorse development in East Davis.  There are four units per building, each unit gets one half of a two-car garage, and all four share a coin-operated washer-dryer set.  Each unit is separately owned, and the condominium association maintains the building exterior and common areas. At the center of the circular layout is a shared pool and common room that can be reserved by residents.  These condos are generally among the least expensive housing in Davis, but since they are often lived in by their owners it is generally quiet and well maintained.

Each building has a ground-floor flat (#1), over-the-garage flat (#4), and two mirror-image two-story units on the side.  Most reports indicate the #1 unit is most desirable, and the #3 is least desirable.  Note that they are not part of the new Wildhorse construction... they were constructed in the early 1970's, and until a few years ago were surrounded by open fields on three sides.  The new construction means the greenbelt, [Nugget Fields], and Sandy Motley Park join the Oak Tree Park and nearby Nugget Market and Longs Drugs making this a very pleasant living space.

On the down side, the list of Codes, Covenants and Restrictions for this community is rather thick, so don't plan on doing things like changing your "yard", or hanging clotheslines, and only the #4 unit has any significant "porch". One rule that does seem to stay bent is the requirement to lock the laundry room in each unit... most are left unlocked to allow you to access more than one washer/dryer at a time to shorten laundry day, in spite of regular warnings from the management that this invites vandalism.

A Unitrans bus line stops near the center of the development. Parking in the driveways is limited, though there is usually parking available on the street.
