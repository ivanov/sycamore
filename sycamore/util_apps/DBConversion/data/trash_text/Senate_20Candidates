This page is incomplete.  We need some basic profiles on the candidates that are known...

''2005-01-21 01:39:30'' [[nbsp]] Why does ["L.E.A.D."] have only six candidates? --["PhilipNeustrom"]
------
''2005-01-22 16:20:48'' [[nbsp]] We don't know.  Maybe it's because they havent' realized that there are going to be eight seats up.  Maybe they realized that they aren't going to win more than six seats, anyway.  Or maybe it's because ["FUCK" Friends] stole all of the cool people.  A better question would be, why are there 17 candidates for 8 seats on Friends Urging Campus Kindness?  Of course, the answer to that is 500 free flyers and free Aggie space. --["BrentLaabs"]

''2005-01-24 17:02:48'' [[nbsp]] Do we have info on Student Focus candidates, or are there none? O_o Also, we need to start getting some basic pages up for these people. --["PaulAmnuaypayoat"]------
''2005-01-24 18:52:16'' [[nbsp]] Yeah, I think we should copy the material from votelead.com for now for the lead folks.  AFAIK Focus hasn't finalized their candidates yet (but I'm sure we'll know this week) --["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2005-01-24 18:59:56'' [[nbsp]] I just emailed Darnell (from LEAD) and asked him to increase their presence on the wiki. :) --["JackHaskel"]------
''2005-01-25 01:47:24'' [[nbsp]] Focus has finalized their candidates list, they just haven't made it public according to Jenni Beeman.  She wouldn't tell me who was on it.  Personally, I expect Kalen to appoint some people who want to run on the Senate for the intirim positions -- he really doesn't stand to lose much politically at this point given the circumstances.  And Jack, I talked to Darnell today, and I think he'll take your advice. --["BrentLaabs"]

''2005-01-29 01:22:58'' [[nbsp]] The Student Focus Candidates are named on the Focus facebook group, except for "Chad", whose first name but not last name was supplied by ["Students for an Orwellian Society"] Innerparty intelinfo.  Avi already has a campaign page up, so become educated and look it up.  Heck, if ["Davis College Republicans" DCR] got a seat, why not ["Davis College Democrats" DCD]? --["BrentLaabs"]
