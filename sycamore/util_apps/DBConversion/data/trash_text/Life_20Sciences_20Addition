It houses the ["Biological Sciences" Division of Biological Sciences] in the basement.  
There is a DNA sculpture that hangs in the stairwell and you can see to the top of the double helix if you stand underneath it.

LSA also contains many labs for researchers in the biological sciences.  It connects to the other large biology lab building, ["Briggs Hall" Briggs] via an external walkway.
