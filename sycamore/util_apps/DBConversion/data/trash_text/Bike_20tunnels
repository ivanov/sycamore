There are several bike tunnels in Davis.

Notable ones are:

 * The one on Richards between ["Redrum Burger"] and ["Davis Commons"] (pictured above).

    
    ''According to ["JoshFernandez"], back in the early nineties all the Davis teenagers used to call this the '''butthole'''''. - ["RobRoy"]
 
 * The one under LaRue next to ["Segundo"].

 * The one behind ["Davis Commons"] and along the ["Bike Paths" bike path] that goes under I-80.  This is known as the ["South Davis Bike Path"].

 * The ["H St. Bike Tunnel"] -- goes under the train tracks between H and J. A short bike path connects J street (through the ["J Street Apartments"]) to H street. The J street side of the tunnel is accessed by a bike path that starts just north of Drexel and winds through the apartment complex. The H street side is about a block or so south of the ["Covell train overpass"]. Best way to get across the tracks if you need to get to campus and a train is blocking your path.

 * The underpass by ["Olson Hall"] is not exactly a tunnel but is still notable. This pedestrian bridge connects ["Olson Hall"] and ["Shields Library"]. While not a direct route for much walking, it has lots of shaded benches which makes it a great ["Study Spots" Study Spot].
