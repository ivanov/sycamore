''Free Cone Day'' is a ["Ben & Jerry's"] tradition that goes all the way back to 1979. When Ben and Jerry first started out in Vermont in the Spring of 1978, they decided that if their business last a year then they would have a Customer Appreciation Day where they would give away free ice cream all day. And so the company still does.

Customers gather in a long line and eat the ice cream on the lawn in front of the store.  Children play.  Dogs bark.  A splendid time is had by all.

In 2005 ''Free Cone Day'' is on '''April 19th'''. The Scoop Shop in Davis will be open from Noon until 9pm.

In 2004 the ["KDVS" KDVS Sound System] spun records all day long and, as a community sponsored organization, collected over a hundred dollars in donations. Over 6,000 ["Discounts and Freebies" free servings] of ice cream were scooped. In 2005 the staff of Ben & Jerry's will plan a lot of crazy fun stuff as well as give away lots and lots of free ice cream.
