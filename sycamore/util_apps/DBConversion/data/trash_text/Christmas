The Davis Holiday Tree in 2004 had LED lights with many signs talking about how they were saving tons of money.  The tree sits in ["E Street Plaza"].

= Groups =

The Lutherian ["Spiritual Organizations" church] hosts several events ["Downtown" downtown], including caroling, a live nativity and various public displays.  They are very friendly and open and have some darn good cookies.

= Houses =

I love the houses that go all out for decorating during the holidays. - ["BevSykes"]

["The Davis Enterprise"] entertainment editor, ["Derrick Bang"], who is a Peanuts afficionado (he's ["Published Authors" written three books about Peanuts]), has a house filled with Peanuts characters as well as other cartoon characters.  This year he added his own radio station, 106.9 FM, which you can get if you are within half a block of his house.  It plays continuous Christmas music.
