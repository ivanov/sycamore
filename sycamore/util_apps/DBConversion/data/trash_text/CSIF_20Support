The collective of 12 student programmers managed my Jim Moersfelder who provide technical support in the ["Computer Science Instructional Facility"].

Find them in '''Room 47''' in the basement of ["Kemper Hall" Engineering II] any time ["Computer Science Instructional Facility" CSIF] is open.

They've got a '''["microwaves" microwave]''' in there if you've got something you want to nuke, and a '''minifridge''' if you've got a beverage you want to cool down, but keep in mind that eating is not allowed inside the ["Computer Science Instructional Facility" labs] (i.e. eat in the halls).

CSIF Support staff can reset your password, help you with issues of logging in, help you print something out, etc.

'''If you're having trouble logging in:''' it is most likely a quota issue, do the following
 * press ''ctrl-alt-f1'' on one of the CSIF machines
 * login at the terminal
 * type ''quota -v'' to see if you're at your quota, if you are
 * delete some of your files (you can use ''du --max-depth=1 | sort -n'' to see which of your directories is taking up the most space
 * once you're done, press ''ctrl-alt-f7'' to get back into X, and login with the graphical interface as usual
