This is a place for any stories about being ["Downtown"].

I was walking ["Downtown"] late one fall evening, alone, and cold.  My studying was done with, most every store was closed, but walking back home wasn't an option -- I had reached the point of no return.  The point where walking around and enjoying the crisp fall evening was better than an attempted run home.  The streets were empty and the town was dead.  Not even the friendly homeless in the park by ["Crepeville"] were around.  I wandered through ["Central Park"] and sat in the grass for a bit before heading toward ["Tower Records" Tower] to meet a friend.  As I passed by the usual corner, where ["Cafe Roma" Downtown Roma] sat, I suddenly heard a rush of sound.  A whole group of people -- one with a large instrument (a fancy looking fellow), another a homeless man with a guitar, and some other folks singing and clapping -- were playing around, making music, right there on the corner.  The sound lit up the whole block.

Those guys hang out in ["Central Park"] every weekend. - ["KenjiYamada"]
  * Even the guy in the nice clothes with the huge instrument? - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
    * I'm not sure, I think I've seen somebody matching that description. - ["KenjiYamada"]

In April of 2000, the performing stage in the ["E Street Plaza"] was dedicated.

It had been the decision of the [http://www.davisdowntown.com/ Downtown Business Association] and City of Davis Employees to dedicate the performing area to [http://wheel.dcn.davis.ca.us/~basykes/paul.htm Paul Sykes], lead singer of ["The Band Lawsuit"].  Engraved bricks and a plaque had been placed in the stage area.

The night of the dedication, a crowd assembled to watch a videotape of Paul's last [http://wheel.dcn.davis.ca.us/go/basykes/paul7.htm monologue show] at the ["Palms Playhouse"] and listen to music by Paul's 3 siblings, members of his former band, and Chris Webster of ["Mumbo Gumbo"]
