From Spring 2001 to Winter 2002 Tiqula Bledsoe was the President of ["ASUCD"] and ran as a member of the ["LEAD"] ["Slate" slate].  He declared himself the "Black Caesar of ASUCD", apparently as a means of asserting his power.  This, of course, led to some controversy, including some of the  hate that the ["LEAD"] slate received:

A reference to his Imperial Majesty caused problems for the ["California Aggie"] when they [http://www.splc.org/printpage.asp?id=866&tb=reports&edition=22 referenced him] in their April Fools' edition.

Bledsoe also routinely asserted that he be called "the Reverend Tiqula Bledsoe," and referred to himself by numerous additional egomaniacal nicknames, such as "the Mohammed Ali of ASUCD," and even "half man, half amazing."

He left the office of ASUCD President with an unusually high debt in his allocated budget, causing ASUCD to have to do some juggling to survive the rest of the fiscal year.  It also came to light after he left office that he had attempted to use ASUCD funds for his personal limo to the "President's Ball" (putting on a ball isn't exactly a normal ASUCD activity either, and in this case it ran a huge debt whereas it was supposed to break even), and to pay for parking tickets he'd incurred in the state capitol, among other things.  ["Mark Champagne"] prevented this money from actually being spent -- fortunately for all students who are not Tiqula Bledsoe.
