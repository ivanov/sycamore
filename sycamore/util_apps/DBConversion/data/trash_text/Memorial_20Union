The first thing many visitors to Campus see, the MU contains a variety of interesting places and things.  

= History =
According to the [http://vtour.ucdavis.edu/vs_pages/vtour/slides/slide_mu.htm UCD V-tour], it was "dedicated in 1955 to honor UC Davis students who lost their lives in military service."  At least part of the [http://www.ucdavis.edu/history.html $1 million cost] was raised by the then-new [http://www.ucdavis-alumni.com/mission.htm Cal Aggie Alumni Assocation (CAAA)].  It was [http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/general_history/campuses/ucd/housing.html built on the site of West Hall], which was constructed in 1917 and housed 67 men until 1955.  When originally built the MU was only a single story building, but fund raising campaigns from 1961 to 1968 added the second, third and fourth stories along with the ["MU Games Area"] and the ["UC Davis Bookstore"].  It was last renovated in 1996 to bring the seismic safety rating from "poor" to "good", at a cost of $8.4 million.  The 4 story concrete latice that is visible from the south side of the MU was added at that time to reinforce the building.

The wind chimes on the north side are nice to listen to, particularly during the spring.

= Commercial operations =
The MU places host to several commercial operations, some owned and operated by UC Davis itself, other private businesses that lease space from UC Davis via the ["MU Auxillary Services department"] (homepage: [http://www-muas.ucdavis.edu/]).
==First Floor ==
 * ["MU Information Center"]
 * ["Post Office"]. Small post office that will soon move to a larger location in the MU.
 * ["STA Travel"].  A corporate travel agency that caters to students.  Company home page: [http://www.statravel.com/]
 * ["Aggie Student Store"].  Affectionately known as the ASS.  Sells candy and, more importantly, $1 Icees.

 [[BR]](*Note the Basement connects with ["Lower Freeborn Hall"])
 * ["MU Games Area"].  Arcade and bowling alley.
= Affiliated/nearby operations =
 * ["UC Davis Bookstore"].  We wouldn't be a campus without a place to gouge the hell out of us on textbook prices, right? 
 * ["ASUCD"] ["Coffee House"].  The place to get some yums. (I guess it [http://www-ucdmag.ucdavis.edu/fall98/EndNotes.html used to be] in East Hall!)  Home page: [http://asucd.ucdavis.edu/services/shops/coffeehouse/]
