The UU Church bills itself as "noncreedal" although [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarian_Universalist historically the denomination originated as a Christian sect].  Its members are from a variety of religious and non-religious traditions, including Christianity, Buddhism, and atheism to name a few.  Services consist of lighting a chalice, hymn-singing (using hymns that sound vaguely Christian but don't contain specifically Christian doctrine), a period of silence for meditation and prayer, and a sermon whose topic is not typically a text from the Bible as is common in Christian churches, but instead may range "from explorations of Unitarian Universalism, to the politics of food, to the quality of resiliency" ([http://www.uusofdavis.org/]).

"Noncreedal" meaning no "precisely phrased statements of belief to which members have to subscribe."  ([http://www.uua.org/aboutuu/uufaq.html Official UU FAQ]) -- TerryCliff
