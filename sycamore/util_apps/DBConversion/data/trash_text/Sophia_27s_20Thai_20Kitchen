Sophia's Thai Kitchen is considered by many the best food stop in all of Davis. It is reasonably priced for Thai food and they give refills on the Thai Iced Tea.  Wait times, especially for dinner on Friday and Saturday night, stretch to 45 minutes or more.  There isn't a waiting area, per se, but many people wait in the bar.  Patrons under 21 are not allowed in the bar area, however.  They hand out puck-sized beepers that buzz/flash when your table is ready.

Their curries are not coconut milk based (which makes them less creamy tasting).  ["Thai Recipes"] (amongst others) has coconut milk based curries.

The adjacent bar is also extremely popular.  If you want to run into a TA on a Friday night, this is probably a good place to look.  And Wednesday night has an entirely different feel because of $1 well drinks, drawing out lots of ["bros"] (in search of T&A--which sometimes they find here). The cover charge on Wednesdays is $5.

 * There is much debate in Davis about the merits Sophia's. I think that most of of the food flat out sucks. The only good thing they serve are the endless Iced Teas. - ["JackHaskel"]
