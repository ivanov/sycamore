There are many Temporary Buildings on ["Campus"].  A lot of them are collected together to the East of ["Walker Hall"].

Classes and labs take place in the temporary buildings.

According to Assistant Vice Chancellor of Campus Planning Robert Segar*, as of 2004, not a single temporary building constructed has ever been removed. TB 001 is still standing and in use on west campus. This record can't hold for long, though; both ["Giedt Hall"] and the ["Physical Sciences Expansion Facilities"] seem to be planned to be built in place of existing temporary buildings.

There have however been a number of "non-permanent" buildings that have been and gone. An example would be the trailer complex known as the "Admin Annex" that used to be south of the Buehler Center. There are also gaps in the numbering system such as TB 4, which may be due to TB's getting renamed... and then removed once renamed. Records indicate that TB 8 dates from 1908, but TB 1 dates to 1947.

These buildings go by 'TB #' on ["SISWEB"].
