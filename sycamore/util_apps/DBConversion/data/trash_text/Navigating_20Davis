["Davis"] is a fairly easy city to navigate because a lot of the city was planned out.

["Downtown"] Davis is on the grid system where lettered streets run north south and numbered streets run east west. On north south streets, addresses start at the last numbered street. For example, on E street, the 300 block is between 3rd street and 4th street. The same applies to most north south streets in ["Central Davis" Central] and Downtown Davis.

On a clear day, from some locations, there are hills visible to the west, which can be useful in navigation.

["East Davis"] is confusing, so I try and avoid it.


Major east/west throughfares include:
 * ["Covell"] -- not to be confused with ["Cowell"] (see ["Covell vs. Cowell"])
 * ["8th St."] -- Divided into East and West 8th; the split occurs at A Street
 * ["5th st." 5th St.] -- which turns into ["Russell Blvd."] west of B Street, as the ["City Hall" city hall] is located at 23 Russell Blvd.

Major north/south throughfares include
 * ["Arthur"]
 * ["Sycamore"]
 * ["Anderson Rd."] -- becomes ["La Rue"] south of ["Russell Blvd." Russell].
 * ["Oak"]
 * ["F St."]
 * ["L St."]
 * ["Pole Line Rd."]

Important connecting streets:
 * ["Richards Blvd."] -- connects South Davis with downtown via the underpass.
 * ["Pole Line Rd."] -- connects South Davis with East Davis via an overpass.
 * Mace Boulevard -- as Covell curves southward, it becomes Mace, which connects to South 
 Davis.
