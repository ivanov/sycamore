'''The Pottery Place is closing for good January 30, 2005.'''

The Pottery Place has bique (unglazed pottery) you can come in and paint, and within a week it is fired and ready for pick-up.  You can use the plates and mugs and stuff in the microwave and the dishwasher.  You generally want to give yourself a couple of hours to paint, because if you've never painted (glazed) pottery before, it might take longer than you think it will.

''The pricing:''

 *Studio fee covers using the glazes and firing of your pieces ($10 for adults, $5 for kids 10 & under)

 *To the studio fee you add the cost of the pieces you pick out to paint (they range from $2.50 to $40)

''Special days:''


 *2 for Tuesday: 2 adults can come in together and the studio fee will be $10 together instead of $10 each

 *15% off Wednesday: all pottery you paint that day will be 15% off
