This ["Thrift Stores" Thrift Store] almost went out of business when they were getting kicked out of the place they are in now. The citizens of ["Davis"] cared so much, that they gave them enough money and donated enough junk that they remained open. It was a close call for them. This is probably my favorite Thrift Store along with the ["SPCA Thrift Store"] in Davis. Most stores are very picked through in Davis, but I've found some good clothes at both of those. 

Re-Runs has a variety of womens and mens clothing, childrens' toys, electronics, table cloths, fabric, jewelry and kitchen accessories.
