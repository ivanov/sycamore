'''The Loyola House''' (AKA List House, Unlist House, YSDHC house etc.) is located at 2938 Loyola Dr. 
Not to be confused with that other Loyola house @ ["2500 Loyola"]


This house is the base of operations for ["You See Davis Hardcore"] and has been a practice/recording space for many local musicians. These walls have been home to many parties (Hardcore Halloween I,II, Sachipalooza I,II) and the matress enforced "soundproof" garage has held lots of shows. We used to have a fire pit but the asthmatic neighbor complained... we totally lose points for not having the fire pit.

'''Who Lives Here?'''

["SusanParson" Sue], Sachi, Joe, ["TheRadish" Radish], Alex, Pinche Hector

'''Bands That Have Tore Up The Garage'''
