Jusco has a special half off discount on their lunch buffets for men on tuesdays and women on wednesdays. Straight couples won't get a discount for both on the same day but it might make a cheap sushi buffet date for gay couples. Awesome, no?

The food is ok, not as good as fuji across the street, but it is cheaper after all. Both places employ chinese people but the food and service at jusco seems more chinesey, meaning they walk around with a tray with some things asking you if you want stuff like at dim sum.

Jusco could be the most reccommended DINNER sushi in Davis. It's $15 all you can eat, and you pick the sushi you'd like MADE FRESH off of their menu. They have a tasty selection of fried snackables (salt&pepper prawns, calamari) included.
