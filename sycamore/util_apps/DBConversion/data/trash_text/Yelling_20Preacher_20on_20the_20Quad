He has a beard and wears all denim. He stands on the grass near of the center walkway and screams about Jesus until his voice is hoarse. And after his voice is hoarse he screams for another hour. Sometimes people bring chairs out to listen to him rant.

And then he disappears for months, only to return again to do the same thing. No one has ever seen him convert anyone. But he certainly is one of the more elusive of the ["Town Characters"].


''I'm not sure but this may be a reference to "Brother Jed," a rather portly gentleman who wears suspenders and rants about the sin of premarital kissing, shouts "trollop!" at passing sorority girls, and makes frequent references to his "viiirgin daughter."  Sometimes she accompanies him and wiley young men plot to seduce her, or at least find out if she's really as good as her father thinks.  When he's not here he's at other universities, I believe he spends all his time going from university to university doing this.  He has a [http://www.brojed.org/ webpage] and is "brojed" on AIM actually.  I've had him on my list for at least a year now actually but never felt saucy enough to start a conversation with him, or even IM him.'' -["KrisFricke"]

''Definitely a great event, I've seen him a few nights in the spring'' - ["RohiniJasavala"]

''I've seen brother Jed on campus before, but there's also this really skinny guy who will start yelling and preaching.  He's always dressed in somewhat shabby clothes, but he always wears a tie.  He has a slight mustache, and is good at quoting the bible.  Not really good about processing the information, but hey, he's good at yelling too.  I'd like to see shabby skinny mustache and tie guy square off against the heftier Brother Jed.  Could this guy I'm describing be ["Crazy Joe Sherman" Joe Sherman]?'' -["JaimeRaba" jr]

 * ''Oh yeah, that is certainly ["Crazy Joe Sherman" Crazy Joe]. - ["RobRoy"]''

''2004-12-26 18:50:31'' [[nbsp]] He has his right to be there. But please dont confuse him with my ["Alpha Gamma Omega"] -AGO brothers (the Christian Fraternity that prays near the flagpole at 12 PM every school day) --["GeorgejAndrews"]------
''2004-12-26 23:52:00'' [[nbsp]] Off topic, but isn't it contrary to Matthew 6:6 to pray at the flagpole at 12 pm every school day? --["KenjiYamada"]------
''2004-12-28 00:38:02'' [[nbsp]] i’ m really glad you brought up that point. At first 4 years ago, i was confused by the 12 PM prayer also because it seemed like the excact actions of the Pharisees in the bible. But the flagpole location is used out of connivence. Most of the AGO guys pray there because most of us are around the flagpole area at noon. But i totally understand how it could be misinterpreted that way. In Matthew 6, Jesus was making a jab at the boastful Pharisee who had a “holier then you” attitude. AGO does not pray with a holier attitude. In fact, all are welcome into the prayer circle. Come join us :-) --["GeorgejAndrews"]------
''2004-12-28 07:56:18'' [[nbsp]] I'm not religious but thanks for the invitation.  Maybe the criticism could be avoided by meeting at the flagpole and then going somewhere private to pray?  --["KenjiYamada"]
