Moderately expensive place, you can get a good dinner for about $11/person including tax and tip. It's the type of place where you can go casually dressed with a bunch of friends, or semi dressy on date or celebratory meal. 

It's good to know that the menu is written entirely using the dishes traditional Thai names without any English translation. (There actually is a bit of english translation, but only in assisting with the meaning of "beef", "pork", "chicken", and "shrimp" in Thai.

If you have no idea what to get and you're just looking for some damned good food, Pad Thai (the most famously known Thai dish) comes highly recommended. $8.95

You can also request the spiciness level of the food to be adjusted to your liking (e.g. mild to very spicy).  'Very spicy' is known as ''Thai hot'' here.  If you really likely spicy stuff, be sure to request it as they won't suggest it (they found too many customers were ordering it and sending it back because it was too spicy).

If you get served by ["BrianMartinez" the tall waiter with a goatee] be sure to tip handsomely!
