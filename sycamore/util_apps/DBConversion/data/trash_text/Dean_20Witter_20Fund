The Dean Witter Fund will give you $12/person to take a professor out to lunch. No joke. However, the application form states that "Undergraduates will not be reinbursed for their own meal." So what's the point?

''Well, most places you go aren't going to give individual receipts, so I guess if you took multiple professors out to lunch and kept them each under $12 you could be reimbursed that way.'' -- ["ArlenAbraham"]
