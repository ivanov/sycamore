Davis has a very strange relationship with J.R.R. Tokein's book ''The Hobbit'', as well as with the other ''Lord of the Rings'' books. There are streets named after places and characters from these novels (in the ["Village Homes"]), and ["The Domes"]--which look like Hobbit houses--are located in "Baggins End."
