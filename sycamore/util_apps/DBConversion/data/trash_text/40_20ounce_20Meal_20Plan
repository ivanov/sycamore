It is a simple plan. A ["Freshmen" freshman] swipes someone over 21 in the ["Dining Commons" DC] and in return the person of age buys the Freshman booze. 

Although the '''40 ounce Meal Plan''' is illegal, remember the law makers that made it illegal to drink before the age of 21 were able to drink legally when they were 18. So you know the system is fucked.
