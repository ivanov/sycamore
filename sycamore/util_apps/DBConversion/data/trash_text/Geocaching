[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching Wikipedia:] Geocaching is an outdoor sport that involves the use of a Global Positioning System ("GPS") receiver to find a "geocache" (or "cache") placed anywhere in the world. A typical cache is a small, waterproof container containing a logbook and "treasure". Geocaching is a unique take on a traditional Easter-egg hunt in that it uses two recent technologies, the GPS and the Internet.

Davis has lots of geocaches spread all throughout the area. You probably walk by a couple every day not even knowing it. 

Please don't ruin the fun of the "sport" by revealing the location or details of caches you find. It would also be taboo to map them. 

Have Fun!

Note that if you don't feel like making the financial investment in a GPS, you can give ["LetterBoxing"] a try.
