Right by ["Dos Coyotes"] and ["Safeway"] in ["South Davis"], "Fusions" is a completely mediocre place to eat dinner. Sure, the food is okay, but nothing special. They serve a mix of asian and californian food -- with results that end up being a bit bland and (for what you get) not a very good value.  I had a chicken dish w/ spinach noodles. It lacked good presentation and flavor. If anyone knows of dishes they can do well, by all means post them.

According to Superpages, they have " Vegetarian,Take Out,Heated Patio,Catering "

Bonsai Beef is quite good. -Andrew
