Chabad of Davis is an Orthodox Jewish community center/synagogue. The Rabbi here is Rabbi Shmaryahu Brownstein. 

If you're Jewish, and you're not sure what a Chabad House ''is'' then you should come for some Shabbat, because words can't describe a Chabad house.

[[TableOfContents]]

Chabad is Hebrew: &#1495;&#1489;&#1524;&#1491;., and for those who can't read Hebrew, it is pronounced [xAbAd] (transcribed according to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-SAMPA X-SAMPA] system). ''I would just say that the Ch should be pronounced like the ch in "Bach", but Americans tend to pronounce that wrong too. The sound doesn't exist in english.-- ["KenBloom"]''


== Shabbat ==

Shabbat services and dinners are held at the following times, varying throughout the school year:

||<bgcolor='#E0E0FF'> '''Quarter'''             ||<bgcolor='#E0E0FF'> Friday Night ||<bgcolor='#E0E0FF'> Saturday Morning  ||

== Classes for Winter Quarter 2005 ==


Hi, everyone,

The study of Torah is the secret to the survival of the Jewish People throughout the ages, besides for being interersting. We have a fabulous array of classes planned for the coming quarter, so Torah study is at your fingertips. We encourage everyone to come to at least one class, which requires no more than an hour a week for some stimulating and provocative discussion of Judaism in our lives. Even if you miss a class in the series, you'll still be able to jump in next time. Look through the list and find a class that appeals to you.

No background is neccessary, and classes are free. To join a class, reply or just drop in. It's best to keep in touch, so you can be kept up-to-date about any changes.

Happy New Year and Shabbat Shalom,
Rabbi Shmary
