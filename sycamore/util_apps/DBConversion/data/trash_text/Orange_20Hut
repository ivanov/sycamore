Close to campus and pretty good.  Lunch is pretty cheap and comes with free fruit.  The food there is closer to ["MarieHuynh" Marie]'s mother's cooking than any other asian place in town.  Except for the general's chicken with red food coloring.  That's at most Chinese restaurants because for you crazy Americans.  

Also, these guys are AWESOME if you want to ["Study Spots" study] there during lunch.  And as with any other study spot restaurant, remember to buy something.

If you go there often and at the right time, you might get some special treatment (ie free potsticker or more food for less $)
