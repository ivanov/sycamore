= Davis Wiki CSS =

CSS files change the appearance of the wiki on your computer.  If don't like the way the wiki looks, you can create your own CSS file and point to it in the "User CSS URL" field of your Settings.  However, the ["Davis Wiki"] CSS looks beeeee-autiful, so why would you want to do that?

Mike manages the CSS (since it's on the server anyway).  If you've got suggestions for something, be they specific ("add this particular value to this particular component of the CSS") or more general ("I want more pink color!"), post them below!

''08/07/2004 07:02:37 PM'' [[nbsp]] Change suggestion: make all non-linked images display: block intead of display: inline.  That will keep explanatory text from streaming off to the right, and appear underneath the image directly without an extra linebreak. - ["PaulLanzi"]------
''08/07/2004 07:11:10 PM'' [[nbsp]] Change suggestion: h2 margin-left: 5px ; h3 margin-left: 10px; h4 margin-left: 15px.  This will indent the sub-titles a bit.  Dunno if the content underneat this neatly indented titles would also be indented... need to check that out, I think. - ["PaulLanzi"]

''2004-08-08 02:08:24'' [[nbsp]] I modified the CSS to reflect the image suggestion.  Let me know if anything breaks.  The only thing I can see is that non-link images in ["Recent Changes"] don't get aligned right in the table, but I'll fix the image and it will look ok.  I am not sure about the headline margins, so I haven't done anything with those yet.  Perhaps instead of a margin we should use padding on the left side?  This might look better, since the text below does not indent. - ["MikeIvanov"]------
''2004-08-08 02:14:13'' [[nbsp]] Actually, I reverted the image thing because it doesn't allow for an intuitive left-to-right layout for small and medium size images(without using tables).  I think we'll have to think about a different approach. - ["MikeIvanov"]------
''2004-10-13 02:52:22'' [[nbsp]] I screwed around with the tabs a little, let me know if you guys like/hate it. - ["MikeIvanov"]------
''2004-10-13 10:31:31'' [[nbsp]] I can't decide if I like it or not (yet), but it does help Help/Info look different from the Page-Link tabs. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2004-10-18 14:44:19'' [[nbsp]] I think the text at http://www.worldwidewiki.net/wiki/SwitchWiki reads well.  Maybe we should use that? - ["PaulLanzi"]------
''2004-10-18 14:45:25'' [[nbsp]] (That was actually ME commenting.  I was logged in as paul because I left myself like that in ["Kerr Hall"] ages ago. . - ["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2004-10-18 15:41:29'' [[nbsp]] Do you mean the font? - ["MikeIvanov"]
------
''2004-10-19 16:10:50'' [[nbsp]] I reverted this page because the font we use now isn't found on this machine in Kerr when using Mozilla.  Konqueror displays it fine, though.  So I think we need to get some feedback from more platforms. - ["MikeIvanov"]------
''2004-10-19 16:54:25'' [[nbsp]] did you change anything else?  The h tags are displayed as a dashed gray on this machine (IE in Shields).  The reason the font didn't display is that it wasn't installed - linux has crappy fonts. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2004-10-19 16:55:21'' [[nbsp]] (this is apparently IE 6.0.blah) - ["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2004-10-19 17:45:53'' [[nbsp]] Nothing else has been changed as far as I know.  I guess Mozilla doesn't use the KDE fonts?  I hope decent font management and compatability  becomes a reality in the near future.  I'll check out what's up with the way the machines at Shields show it. - ["MikeIvanov"]
