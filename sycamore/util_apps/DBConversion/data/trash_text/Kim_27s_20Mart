Kim's is the only Asian market in Davis. The selection is not too bad considering the size of the store. Aside from the usual shelved goods (rice, ramen, spices, sauces, snacks), you can also buy some refrigerated food (seafood, vegetables). Prices are fairly high since they don't really have any competition.

Although the prices might seem high, relative to asian products you find at grocery stores such as Safeway, the prices are GREAT.  I've purchased sushi supplies several times from Kim's mart such as nori and rice vinegar, and everything cost about half as much.  --["NatalieKitchiner"]

''2005-02-01 16:44:41'' [[nbsp]] Considering that Kim's is the *only* Asian market in Davis, I think it's really important to support the place. Besides, the woman who owns the place is very friendly! Having grown up in Sac and shopped it's Asian stores for years, I don't think Kim's prices are out of line. --["AlphaDog"]
