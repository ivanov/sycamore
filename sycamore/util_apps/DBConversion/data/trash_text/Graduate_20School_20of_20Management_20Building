It's going to be right near the proposed ["Hotel and Conference Center"]. There are less articles available on this thing though. Here's an attempt to explain the history of the Graduate School of Management building through a fictional dialog.

'''<Robert Mondavi>''': Hello, I am a rich wine baron*. Please take this pile of money and build a ["Mondavi Center" Center For The Performing Arts] and ["Mondavi Institute" Institute For Wine And Food Science] in my name.[[BR]]
'''<Chancellor Vanderhoef>''': Sure. We will build it on the south side of campus, where there is currently nothing.[[BR]]
'''<Vanderhoef Advisor>''': Perhaps we should build some other things near it, to populate that side of campus.[[BR]]
'''<Chancellor Vanderhoef>''': Great idea. But I don't want to spend a lot of money! We should make other people build the things.[[BR]]
'''<Vanderhoef Advisor>''': Okay!

Probably the only reasonable source of information on this building is [http://www.ormp.ucdavis.edu/realestate/projects/gsm/index.html the section dedicated to it] at the UC Davis Real Estate site.

''* is "baron" pejorative? If so, please don't sue me.'' -- ["TravisGrathwell"]
