Quite possibly the most insane, fun, exciting, AMAZING weekend ever. Thousands of college kids gather at Lake Shasta for 4 days and 3 nights of complete drunken debauchery.

Also the reason so many girls and boys have been filling the ["ARC"] recently, with hopes of acheiving their ideal "Houseboat-ready" bod. Girls are in bikinis the entire time so preparations must be made months in advance.

Necessities: flotation devices, at least 1 keg per boat, hamburgers and hot dogs, and beer bongs. lots and lots of beer bongs.

If you're in the greek community chances are all your friends will be there, so you better get on a boat quick!!!

| Insert your crazy houseboats story here |

 * Although it's a wonderful time, I must say that houseboats is EXTREMELY dangerous.  I'm not talking about sexual assault or fighting.  The potential for serious injury or death is simply astounding.  I almost died last year when I was really drunk and sleep deprived, tried to climb down the top of my boat, and ended up falling off the side and hitting my throat against the steel railing around the lower deck.  Fortunately, I hit the soft spot between my chin and adam's apple, but I narrowly missed crushing my windpipe or breaking my jaw.  Another silver lining to this story is the fact that I hit the rail rather than fall into the piss/beer/reservoir water stew that surrounds the island we were docked at.  I have many more gruesome stories, but I'll let someone else take over.
