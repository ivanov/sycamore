Target is a discount retailer much like ["Wal-Mart"]. But unlike the aforementioned store, Target attempts to market its goods to a slightly hipper more ["Scenesters" scenesterish] audience. Whatever category of consumer you fall into, Target is an affordable place to shop for all your basic home and wardrobe necessities.

Target hires designers to create the various lines of products that it sells.  The core lines all use the same timeless palette, so the cardboard tissue box matches the towels you bought a couple years ago.  

Wal-Mart, on the other hand, sells inexpensive goods aimed somewhere at middle America.  Thus you have a semi-country feel to the products and lots of (often subtle) patriotic names for the various items.

There is currently a massive ["Davis Wish List: Target" Target Controversy] that has been debated for the past few years.  Target has expressed an interest in building a store on 2nd Street near Mace.
