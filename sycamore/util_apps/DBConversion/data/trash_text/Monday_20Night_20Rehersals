Monday Night Rehersals, or as they are more commonly called, "MNR", is when the ["Aggie Band"] gets to practice all the kick ass songs they play. These rehersals usually happen at the ARC, on Monday Nights, from 7 to 9pm. Show up to one if you want to join. Besides, the ["Aggie Band"] is way cooler than the ["Aggie Pack"], since they travel to places. Like Texas. Or Washington.
