The Wiki is a powerful tool. It therefore might be a good idea to have a discussion about wiki ethics. 

==Some loose guidelines==
 * Respect the opinions of others.  On the other hand, make it clear whether you are expressing a fact or an opinion.
 * Try not to destroy content.  When updating out-of-date content, it may be valuable to keep some of the history.
 * If you don't agree with something, promote dialogue by including all sides of the argument.
 * Use the wiki for good and not evil.
 * This is not a good place to have a casual conversation.  Don't be afraid to summarize or re-organize past entries for the sake of readability.
   * 'Conversation' on a page can usually be turned into something when meaningfully structured.
   * Little streams of comments on the bottom of a page can usually be reworked into different areas of the page.  Use comments left to improve the writeup by putting them in the proper spot.

It likely remains true that Wikis sort themselves out.  Certainly in the case of Davis Wiki, we are blessed with intelligent and respectful people.  That is why any talk of ethics wouldn't be rules but mere guidelines that people might like to follow.

We would all hate to see the wiki turn into a great place to post porn and flame your professors, but this isn't likely to happen as long as we are all respectful and cooperative.  Confrontational statements and material is typically ignored or removed.

==Should anything be taboo? If so, what?==

Possible ideas (add what you want, even if it's just a bud of an idea):
  * Creating pages that intentionally mislead users.  This is not to say that dramatic or humorous wording is disallowed; just that it should be clear to an average reader when something is true versus when something is a joke or tongue in cheek. 
  * Anything that might legally be construed as "Hate". 
  * Confrontational speech is usually edited or removed.  Controversial statements should be attributed to those who say them.
  * Derisive commentary motivated by gender, race, orientation or ''political beliefs'' (''I've removed a number of really derisive comments about the campus conservatives lately - really I find it as offensive as any of the more "commonly recognized" forms of discrimination - there's no place for it here'' -["KrisFricke"])
 * Pornography

''What do you think about users swearing frivolously on the wiki?  This can make the wiki less accessible to others, which is something all users should strive against.  What about treating it like poor grammar and editing it out of pages?  But isn't this disrespectful to other users' opinions?'' -- ["RishiTrivedi"]

''Swearing hasn't really been a problem on the wiki.  Except for maybe a certain slate I'm a part of.  Actually I have a problem with the name, but that's solely for political reasons.  Maybe we should limit swearing to attributed quotes or personal web pages?  I can't see much reason to say "fuck the ducks" in a page on the arboretum, but people should be able to say it as opinion.'' - ["BrentLaabs"]
