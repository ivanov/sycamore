Oh yes, Davis is a weird town.

Because of the building of an overpass, animal lovers worried about toads being smushed by cars commuting from ["South Davis"] to ["North Davis"], since the toads hopped from one side of a dirt lot (which the overpass replaced) to the reservoir at the other end. There was a lot of controversy, and the town decided to use up thousands of dollars to build the toad tunnel, which runs beneath the Pole Line Road overpass.

The entrance of the toad tunnel, starting at the post office parking lot, looks like this:

''I've been exploring these, both in real life and looking up info at the city library.  Despite the "Toad Hollow" name, these are for frogs, not toads, and Toad Hollow has been vandalized since the above picture was taken.  There are also several tunnels rather than just one... I've been trying to map them all out.  The shortest run is in the street opposite Sudwerk's parking lot (linking 2nd to Poleline - a very very non-obvious route).  It does, however, lack any sort of decoration, so it helps if you visit Toad Hollow to get an idea of what you're looking for.  All the tunnels terminate in a fenced in protected wetland area with forboding signs implying that if you climb over the fence, you will cause hundreds of species to die and make Gaia weep.  I need to have an afternoon free to bring a camera during daylight hours.'' -- ["JabberWokky"]
