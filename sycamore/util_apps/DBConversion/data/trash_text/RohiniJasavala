Rohini likes The Simpsons.  Rohini might like your mom, so give her your mom's phone number, just to be nice.

I'm from Modesto, and I am lucky that I made it out without getting hooked on meth or being murdered.
Every time I visit, I'm constantly reminded how I should carry mace, or just not go home.  

I'm a ["Genetics"] major, and I'm a sucker for guys who are in the ["Molecular and Cellular Biology" MCB] department.

I work in the ["Genome Center"], have a ["LiveJournal"], and love my computer.

I hate my ["Lily the Cat" roommates' cat].  

$30 to whoever kidnaps it.
