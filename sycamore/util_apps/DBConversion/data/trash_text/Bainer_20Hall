Bainer Hall was named after Roy Bainer, the founding dean of the College of Engineering. The building houses the Biological and Agricultural, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, and Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering departments as well as Civil Engineering labratories.

Based on its shape, if the building were a spaceship, it would be a Y-wing or maybe the Enterpise.

The student engineering shop is also located in Bainer. If you take lab shop class you can learn to make all kinds of cool stuff.

Other buildings within the College of Engineering include ["Kemper Hall"] and ["EU III"].
