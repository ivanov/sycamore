Fuzio can be a bit pricey, and the portions not so big.  If you're looking for true Italian rather than "fusion," then try ["Caffe Italia"], ["Strings"], or ["Original Pete's"] instead.  Fuzio is a Italian-fusion place -- "Universal pasta".  "Universal" basically means pasta dishes taken from other cultures, homogenized for white people.  A more Asian-centric take on this restaurant theme can be found at ["Fusions Asian Bistro"] in ["South Davis"]. 

Some of the dishes at Fuzio are quite good, such as the chicken curry noodles and the firecracker fizuli.  Fuzio has good martinis and margaritas, too.  If you want a Pad Thai that is merely decent and also surreal in color, try Fuzio's version of this popular Thai item.  Then go to one of Davis' five Thai restaraunts and compare.

For some reason, most all of the waiters/waitresses working here seem to be mutant-super attractive in a hollywood-science-fiction-movie sort of way.  Even so, they also have had stuck-up assholes working there.  Watch out for those bastards, they'll give you horrible looks for asking for water.  But luckily not everyone is like that.

Note also that the majority of ["Sophia's"] bartenders used to work at Fuzio's.  There is an [http://www.fuzio.com/ official Fuzio site] with a menu and other items.
