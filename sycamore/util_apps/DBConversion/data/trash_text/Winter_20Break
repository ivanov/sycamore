Winter Break is a concept known to all but experienced mostly by students at ["UC Davis"] and other ["Schools"].  For UC students, Winter Break starts whenever your last Final is (at most, Dec. 18^th^) and then lasts until Winter quarter begins (Jan. 3^rd^).  While it's not likely to ["Snow" snow] here in ["Davis"], it certainly does in other areas of the world.  Students typically flee Davis in great numbers, leaving the town feeling much lonelier than it did before.

= Heading home for Winter Break =
You'll need some form of ["Transportation" transportation] to get you out of town if you're leaving for break, otherwise you'll be stuck here and most of your friends will be gone.  Heading home can be an interesting experience, especially for ["Freshmen"].  For them, Winter Break is the first time they see their parents after having their ["free beer" newly] ["Frat Parties" found] ["Drinking games" freedom].  And, yes, your parents really are ''that crazy''.


= Staying in Davis during Winter Break =
''stuff to do, experiences, etc should go here''
