Located at 720 Anderson, the house is affectionately referred to as the Bomb Shelter or simply 720.  While this may seem like merely a nickname, the house does sport what seems like a genuine bomb shelter in the back yard.

A brief History of ["720"] Anderson:
    As far as nicknames go, this house was simply ["720"] long before anyone knew there was a bomb shelter in the back yard. In 2001 it was inhabited by 6 major dudes (among them, Brendan, Brett, Otis, and ["RishiTrivedi"]) who were all connected by what will surely go down in history as the most partylicious dorm floor: ["Gilmore 5"] - 2000. Initially some of the 720ers got word from a neighbor that there was a bomb shelter in the back yard. The apathetic bunch took no action for several years. 
    One day while dealing with a fine from the city, ["DanMasiel"] and ["WillKaufman"] decided to look up all the building permits for ["720"]. To their amazement they discovered that, in fact, in 1962 a bomb shelter was built in the backyard, although its location was not revealed on the permit. In 2003, a new member of the household named Dan (whose picture can be seen at the bottom of the ["Delta of Venus"] page), moved into 720 bringing with him nothing more than a sleeping bag and some booze. Late that summer, Dan began digging four foot deep holes in the backyard of ["720"]. On his third hole he hit concrete, and after a long and lazy excavation (sadly interrupted by the rainy season), a concrete covered hatch was discovered. After breaking up the concrete with a sledge hammer, a deep dark hole was revealed. Within that hole was about a foot of filthy standing water and a time capsule. The contents of that time capsule will be revealed in the much anticipated ["MONUMENT"]?. A man by the name of Brendan Boyle then took up the cause of the ["Bomb Shelter"] and the rest is recent Davis history.

The bomb shelter is used for many shows, mostly (if not all?) are accoustic sets by major names in the ["Music Scene"] here in Davis.
