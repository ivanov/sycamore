You may remember rollerblading from back when everybody sported pump shoes, snap-bracelets, and neon was "in."  However, rollerblading is an enjoyable method of ["Transportation" alternative transportation] here in Davis, and is also a great way to ["Outdoor Activities" get out] and see the city.  From nerdy ["engineering students"] to ["ARC" super-fit] athletic gods, rollerbladers come in all shapes in sizes here in Davis.

Rollerblading here in Davis is usually quite easy due to the relative flatness of the terrain.  The only problems you're likely to encounter as a blader is the occasional poorly paved street, as blades are much more sensative to road conditions than ["Bicycles" bikes] are.

One common misconception about rollerblades is that they are slow or inconvient, and that ["Bicycles" bicycles] are much easier to deal with.  Bikes are generally faster than rollerblades and take less energy to use.  However, this is not necessarly a good thing.  You get more exercise blading around than you ever would on a ["Bicycles" bike], and with practice your speed will improve to the point where you will easily outpace average bikers.

= Getting started =
To get started blading you'll need to pick up a pair of rollerblades.  You can get them at a whole number of places, but a used pair would probably do just fine.  After you pick up a pair, take it slow.  There's no need to try them out on ["Campus"] right away.  Once you become comfortable blading around a safe area, take them on ["Campus"] with you.  '''Always''' be alert while on blades on ["Campus"] as it is a zoo of people.  Take it slow, and with time you will learn to navigate the swarms of people easily.

= Great places to blade =
Aside from using blades to get around, they can be used for more casual recreational purposes.  A great place to check out is ["Davis Skate"] -- a group of skaters who meet weekly to sail around Davis.  All levels of bladers can go and have an enjoyable evening.

''I frequently wear my rollerblades while going up and down lecture hall steps, or other such places. People think I'm crazy. Also, if you're going to rollerblade inside the MU, don't go near the area by Information Desk because they'll tell you you're breaking the rules. Also, the bike path along ["Russell" Russell Blvd] can be a challenge to skate in the winter when it's wet, because the path is saturated with olive oil so you'll get no traction.'' --["KenBloom"]
