Located in the lower level of ["Memorial Union"], under the ["UC Davis Bookstore"], the MU Games Area, often abbreviated MUGA, is a fantastic and magical place filled with videogames, ["MU Bowling Alley" a bowling alley] and many pool tables.

HEY LOOK HERE'S AN INCOMPLETE LIST OF THE GAME Machines THEY HAVE:
 * Time Crisis 3
 * Police 911 2
 * Initial D 3 [4 Screens]
 * ["Pump it Up"] Exceed 2
 * Motor Raid
 * Hydro Thunder
 * Guilty Gear XX
 * Marvel Versus Capcom and many other iterations of this series.
 * Soul Calibur 1 [beloved by some but SO OLD]
 * House of the Dead 1
 * Cruisin USA
 * Area 51
 * Some football game, Madden-some-year-or-other.
 * Two air hockey tables that can be heard from upstairs. Apparently air hockey is the loudest of all arcade sports.
 * Ms. Pac-Man/Galaga? [BOTH IN THE SAME MACHINE HOW DO THEY DO IT]
 * Anywhere from one and a half to three pinball machines (depending on how many are broken).
  * one with a mideval siege theme, a Simpsons theme, and something else ["MarieHuynh"] has not played.
 * Two or three random games that look like they're supposed to pay out in tickets or something. Who the hell in the MUGA accepts tickets. I've never tried them.
 * STUFFED TOY CRANE MACHINE
 * Some stupid machine with XBOX games and crap in it that I've never seen anyone win at.
 * Washington Mutual ATM - this one spits out $20 bills if you win (surcharge-free!)

The MUGA is a melting pot (more of a salad bowl, actually) of different gaming cultures, also known as nerds. They tend to divide themselves as such:

 * The humongous throng of Initial D nerds gather around the four-player Initial D machine to race around the same course over and over and watch others do the same.
 * The sweaty-assed mouthbreather Pump It Up nerds stand around next to the Pump It Up Exceed machine and stare at arrows on a screen while taking turns stepping on a metal pad.
 * The weird fighting game nerds huddle in their dark, enclosed area to see whether the X-Men can beat Chun-Li or whatever.

Meanwhile continual streams of normal-type people enter and exit to play either ["MU Bowling Alley" bowling] or pool because they couldn't find a decent frat party to go to.
