KSTE 650 AM[[BR]]
Sacramento, CA

KSTE is an AM talk radio station owned by ClearChannel.  That pretty much makes it conservative talk by default, but their sister station ["KFBK"] carries Rush Limbaugh and the other biggies.  That means that KSTE carries quite a few local shows and winds up being much less conservative in the mornings.

 * 5am to 10am - Armstrong and Getty 
   * A laidback, fairly non-political (for talk radio) show.  When the media went crazy about the Scott Peterson trial in 2004, they were sent to cover the trial.  Instead, they interviewed the other media people, asking why they were insisting on such heavy coverage.  

 * 10am to Noon - Paul and Phil 
   * These two also do a morning FM music program and used to be the Discovery Channel's "Answer Guys".  Paul is a fairly open minded Republican while Phil missed two weeks early this year because he was at the Burning Man festival.  As a result, they tend to tear into any topic from different directions.

 * Late night - Coast to Coast AM
   * Ah, Art Bell's baby.  If you have never listened to Coast to Coast, it is well worth it... everything from UFO abductees to "shadow creatures" to psychics to vampire hunters (no... really).  George Noorey is the new weekday host, and isn't quite able to step into Art's shoes, but the wackos still come out, both as guests and as callers. 


In the afternoon and evenings, they also have Dr. Laura and a handful of conservative types, including some FOX Network regulars. One national host from Northern California (["Bay Area" Marin County]) is controversial conservative Michael Savage, most notably fired from MSNBC for an anti-gay remark.
