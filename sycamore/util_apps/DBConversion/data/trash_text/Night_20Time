When the masses of black crows fly overhead, or the ["Fog" fog] rolls in, it feels like that Davis is a place out of a scary movie.[[BR]][[BR]]borderless:night.jpg [[BR]][[BR]]Other times, you're just really hungry and you want a place to eat or something to do during the night.[[BR]][[BR]]Once night comes along, the little bugs come out.[[BR]][[BR]] borderless:bug1.jpg borderless:bug2.jpg [[BR]][[BR]]You run into these all over ["Campus"] at night, as well as some spots ["Downtown"].[[BR]][[BR]]This page is a place to put things that happen during night time or things to do during night time (or anything night-related, really).

''This guide was originally prepared by ["JaimeRaba" jr] for the November ["King Hall Advocate"].''

''2004-12-06 19:11:15'' [[nbsp]] Where do the over 50s hang out? - ["EmilySaur"]
------
''2004-12-06 23:21:57'' [[nbsp]] In Davis, over 50s tend to hang out at ["Trendy Restaurants"], and randomly appear at Sophia's and Froggy's, depending on the night.   In Sacramento, the scene is much better for the 50+ set. - ["JaimeRaba"]
------
''2004-12-12 16:42:12'' [[nbsp]] Note to self:  Safeway, Albertsons, Nugget hours past 10pm.  Also do seperate night time guides for the bay area and sac. - ["JaimeRaba"]
------
''2005-01-18 01:47:11'' [[nbsp]] Hmm.  Maybe activities should be first.  But I figured most people were more interested in restaurants.  The reason I put those first originally is because most of the listed activities take place at bars, whereas restaurants are open to all, and perhaps would have more applicability to more people.  But I guess I can see the rationale. --["JaimeRaba"]------
''2005-01-18 08:52:36'' [[nbsp]] I think it's nice to have activities first because everyone knows that they can buy food late but other things to do are less known. Plus, it's alphabetical so it works.  --["JackHaskel"]
------
''2005-01-20 08:10:56'' [[nbsp]] I'm a bit perplexed about the "Live Theater" section, as most of those groups seem not to do much at night.  Maybe the last fraction of their last act is after 10pm, but.... maybe that stuff should go on a different page.   --["JaimeRaba"]------
''2005-01-20 08:12:46'' [[nbsp]] And also, "Performing Arts" does not very well discribe hiphop dancing and kareoke.  That Category needs generally to be revised.  Maybe I'll come up with some good way of de-cluttering this page. --["JaimeRaba"]
