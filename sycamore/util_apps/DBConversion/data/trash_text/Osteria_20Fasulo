There is rumored to be an amazing (and amazingly expensive) restaurant on Russell Blvd, just west of the campus' agricultural section, in an old mansion. Anyone got more info?

I know there used to be one out there called ["Plumshire Inn"]. I've been told that it closed about a year or so ago. Apparently it belonged to an old couple who had some hand in developing that area, and that the restaurant was the only business in that particular area. It was their thing, and when they decided to retire, the restaurant closed. From what I had heard, it was a tad expensive, but it was supposed to be, far and away, the best restaurant in Davis (I heard this from my old neighbors, who had eaten there, and were food connoisseurs). As far as I know, a new one did not open in its place, but I could be wrong about that. -["EricKlein"]

http://www.wguides.com/city/281/84_227200.cfm discusses ["Plumshire Inn"]. The phone number works (I called them), but they're closed today, so I guess they still exist. They seem to have a new name though, which I couldn't understand from their recorded message, so someone will have to visit or call back during business hours. And I think I'm game for a bike ride over there to photograph them and confirm their existance. -- ["KenBloom"]

I did a little research, and it seems that the ["Plumshire Inn"] is indeed gone, but has been replaced by ["Osteria Fasulo"] (see their [http://www.osteriafasulo.com/ homepage]). See [http://www.sacticket.com/dining/story/8116041p-9048175c.html this review] for details. The new restaurant is Italian, and quite upscale from what the review has to say. It sounds like it is priced out of the reach of most students (and almost all grad students), but probably has good food. I wish now that I had gone to the old Plumshire Inn while it was still here. Although I like Italian food, Italian restaurants always seem to charge too much for what you get (I'm talking about quality, not quantity. Although, in this case, quantity seems to be an issue as well). -["EricKlein"]


I just took a bike ride, and confirmed this. I have also ruled out the existance of a restaurant any farther west on Russell. (Businesses on Lake Blvd. not withstanding). -- ["KenBloom"]
