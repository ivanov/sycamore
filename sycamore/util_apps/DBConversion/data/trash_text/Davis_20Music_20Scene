From the official website [http://www.davismusicscene.org]:

''DMS is an organization of UC Davis students dedicated to promoting music on campus and in our community. We want to see music thrive; to that end, we support local bands (by giving musicians a chance to connect with each other and a place to perform), the local audience (by holding shows and promoting shows hosted by other organizations), and local venues.

We host concerts weekly on the UC Davis Campus.''

Davis Music Scene was registered as a campus club with ["ASUCD"] in either spring or fall 2002 as an effort to revive the then-dead on-campus music scene. The original officers and organizers were Carl Rennie, Alex Stupakov, Arjun Singh, Blair, and Adam W. (Apologies for botched names)

The first DMS shows were held in 3 Kleiber Hall. Other venues since then have included ["Chem 194" 194 Chemistry] and the ASUCD ["Coffee House"].

The organization currently puts on concerts every Friday at 7 p.m. at the ["Coffee House"] during the school year. Admission has always been free to members, and up to October 2004, membership was also free and unofficial. To recoup some of the costs for hosting these shows , yearly memberships are now sold for $5 at the door, and quarterly memberships are $2. Most concerts will include one Davis band and two out-of-towners. There are no strict requirements for booking your band with DMS, but the waitlist to put on your own show usually stretches out a couple months.

To book a show with DMS, e-mail Arjun Singh at cman_007@yahoo.com .
