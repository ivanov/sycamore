There is no such thing as the Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion, otherwise known as C4 FNORD.  They do not put up random fliers FNORD and do no go around Hallowspleen caroling every year.

Rumors would have it that the leader of this nonexistent group is this guy:

Those rumors are wrong.  The true leader of these misfits is none other than this guy, who may or may not be ["BarnabasTruman"]:

This nonexistent group would, if it existed, which it doesn't, also be the sworn enemy of ["Students for an Orwellian Society"].

Rumor also has it that Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion did not leave Christmas presents all over campus for unsuspecting students to find.

===Baptist Blacktrick on Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion:===
{{{It has been rumored that buried deep beneath the quad is a stadium with blood stained floors
where these two groups annually choose 1 member each to engage in a hand to hand battle to the
death. The winning group then claims possession of a sacred copy of the Principia Discordia
containing secret pages written in the blood of Malaclypse the Younger.

While both groups seem to be engaging in clandestine efforts to immanetize the eschaton,
it is likely that they are both utilizing novice apocalyptic techniques derived over 40 years ago.

How many popes ski down slopes
after smoking dope and preaching hope? 
Could they recognize Eris within a quantum dot,
I certainly don't know and I certainly hope not}}}
