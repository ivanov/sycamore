There is a Davis phenomenon in which people live in garages.

Such as:

 * ["GriffinWalker"] lives in the garage of the ["Pirate Ship"].

 * ["BudCutino"] lives in the garage of ["720"].
 
As you can see in this picture. Bud sleeps in the loft, many times with his girlfriend Caitlin: [[BR]]

 * ["BrettHart"] lives in the garage of the ["Empty House"]
  * I once lived there. -- ["RishiTrivedi"]

 * ["GarrettPierce"] lives in the garage at the ["Gay PD"].

this is my loft. it was hard won and the girls in the house wrinkled their collective noses when i proposed living there. but i love it even though it took some coercion to let me stay there. speaking of coercion, i remet this girl who claimed i told her that like to bring girls into the loft, kick the ladder out from under and proceed to seduce them. when she told me this i shuddered and apologized. she wasnt offended though and said she realized i was joking. ten minutes later into the conversation i was like "well...so... you are here... want to see my loft?"-["BudCutino"]
