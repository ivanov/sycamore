Davis' tribute to the Midwest -- the local Dairy Queen -- offers the usual DQ arsenal including Blizzards and frightening meat products.

''Dairy Queen was started by the guy who literally invented soft serve ice cream.  Technically, soft serve ice cream is named "Dairy Queen" (and the store is named after the product), since soft serve is the "Queen of Dairy Products".  No, I am not making this up.  At any rate, the dessert stuff tends to be good, whereas the food (hamburgers, fries, etc) tends to be bad.  Really bad.  As in "cooked by a guy who normally sells ice cream" bad. -- ["JabberWokky" jw]
