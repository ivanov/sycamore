The Davis Police Department provides law enforcement for the town of Davis.  One officer is ["Midget Cop" remarkably short], which makes him quite noticable.  They are quite distinct from ["UCD Fire and Police" the campus police]. 

The DPD printed and distributed trading cards with interesting information about each officer.  Read about them in an ''Maxim'' article from April 2000 titled [http://www.maximonline.com/stupid_fun/articles/article_3551.html "To Serve and Collect"]. 

Kalie Moody claims that there is at least one undercover officer who she witnessed arresting a woman outside of IHOP at 2am.

Various people have different opinions about police enforcement no matter where you live.  Due to their strict enforcement of Davis' famed ["Noise Violation" noise laws], they are sometimes referred to as "Professional Party Poopers".  Others point out that theirs is a thankless job, and that you can't make everybody happy at once, especially while enforcing laws that you didn't write.

= Page Discussion =

 * ''I'm adding this section because there was an addition made that I was very conflicted with, decided to leave in, and was later removed by another Wiki user.  Very simply put, it described an undercover officer.  I don't think it should have been here, but was loathe to remove information from a page.  Comments?'' -- ["JabberWokky"]
  * Yeah, sometimes it feels wrong to remove something that may be valuable, but this time I thought it was a pretty easy decision.  Just go with your gut feeling, respecting the author's work but also respecting everyone else. -- ["MikeIvanov"]
  * It's partly because the content is easily available in the revision history that I thought it was an easy decision to remove the description.  Yes, it was very general, but I cannot think of any reason that the description added value to this page.  It just didn't seem like it was a very courteous thing to do to describe an undercover officer.  Censorship?  Not really, it's more a matter of being polite.  If someone truly feels the content should be here, he or she can revert it. -- ["MikeIvanov"]
  * Undercover cops that personally conduct busts or make arrests don't tend to remain  anonymous too long. That said, I agree-- not too much value to the page overall. -- ["CentralDavisite"]
