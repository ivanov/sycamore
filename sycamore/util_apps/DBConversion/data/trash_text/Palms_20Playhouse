Palms Playhouse (or just "The Palms") is a concert venue that primarily hosts folk/bluegrass/Americana performances. Past performers include the ["Mad Cow String Band"], Janis Ian, Tom Rush, Dar Williams, the Waifs, and the Nields. 

Once located in an old barn off of Cowell and Drummond in Davis, it moved to the ["Winters"] Opera House in late 2002 to make room for new housing developments. Despite the lack of heating and cooling, the rickety folding chairs, and general lack of space, musicians and their fans returned to the Palms again and again for over 27 years. Activist songwriter Utah Phillips performed at the final concert on August 29, though the real star that night was manager Dave Fleming as he took the stage one last time to say farewell to the old shack. 

The new Palms seats about 220 people and is fully heated and air-conditioned. Located in downtown Winters, shopping and dining are just steps away from the venue. Dave still mans the ticket box at the entrance and announces the night's performers. Tickets are available at ["Armadillo Music"] with a $1.25 service charge and at the door with no service charge. Shows are 21-and-over due to the bar.
