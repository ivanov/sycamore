Joe Finkel was born in Davis in 1980. He has lived in Santa Clara County, New jersey, and Dublin Ireland, among other places. He came back to Davis a couple years ago to form the ["Playboy Millionaires"] with ["JaiziAbedania" Jaizi] and ["GriffinWalker" Griffin].

He works at ["Ink Monkey Graphics"], is a DJ at ["KDVS"], and lives at the ["Pirate Ship"]

Joe with a shirt on is sort of like Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster: elusive.[[center(end)]]
