Village Homes was designed and built (starting in 1964) by Michael and Judy Corbett on 60 acres in ["West Davis"]. The development is comprised of 220 single family homes, 20 apartments, and ["Cooperative Housing"] at ["Sunwise"]. Most of the buildings incorporate solar power and design features. There is business space in the community center, an inn, an olympic-sized pool, and a large playing field. Village Homes is one of the nicest places in ["Davis"] to live.

Many of the streets in this neighborhood are named after places and characters in ["The Hobbit"] and the Lord of the Rings books.
