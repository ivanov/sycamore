This is a page for the people active on this Wiki.  The people who update, comment, and otherwise interact.

If somebody has a better name for this, by all means, suggest it.  I would like to propose a set of community boards created in the following manner.  This would reduce the heavy discussion on a few people's profiles, possibly work better than the ["To Do"] page and allow for a record of what has been discussed.

Some links of interest include ["Davis Wiki"] resources like the ["Wiki History"], the ["Wiki Logo"] which is on the ["Wiki Flyer"] and possibly ["Wiki Sticker"]s.  Links that might interest people who are contributing include the ["Wiki Ethics"] page and ["Wiki Style Guide"]... plus the free for all ["Wiki Sand Box"].  People who are way too devoted to being ["Wikivangelists"] might want to join ["Wikiholics Anonymous"].
