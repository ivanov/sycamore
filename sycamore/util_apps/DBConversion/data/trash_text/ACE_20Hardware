ACE (which old-timers still refer to as "Davis Lumber") has everything from furniture to bulk lumber to plants to cast iron skillets to plumbing supplies to pet supplies. It runs a long length of G Street from 2nd to 4th. The southern section is more oriented toward household items, and you can pay your PG&E and SBC phone bills there. The northern section is similar to a mini Home Depot. The northern section also has a garden and ["Wiki Animals" pet] supplies store in it. If you have unpaid merchandise and need to cross 3rd Street to one of their other buildings, ask a staff member and they'll walk you across the street with it.

A wider selection of lumber can be found at ["Hibbert Lumber"].

The ["Downtown Phone 10" Ace home store has a pay phone ] inside of it located by the entrance nearest to third street.
