The Arboretum Terrace is operated by the UC Davis ["Arboretum"] and a volunteer staff as a demonstration garden. It is home to many beautiful plants that are especially suited for local area gardens. There are plenty of chairs and tables to study at. It is sandwiched between E Street and the train tracks so it can be a little noisy. It doesn't seem to get a lot of visitors.
