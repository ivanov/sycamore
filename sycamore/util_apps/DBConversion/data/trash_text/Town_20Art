There are many ["Art Galleries"] in Davis. 

The town of Davis is home to all sorts of city-sanctioned art such as murals and sculptures.  But there's also a lot of impromtu sort of art lying around there.  Some of it, on the whole, is pretty awful.  But some pieces are hidden treasures.  Here we collect some of both.

 * The ["L and 2nd Garden"]
 * The ["Locomotive Hedge"]
 * ["Cnawan Stone"] sculpture of dancing people at ["Central Park"]
 * ["Davis Family Mural"]
 * ["The Joggers"] aka "The Eyesore" in ["Downtown"]
  Town folklore has it that some hapless passerby tripped and suffered some injury upon the upraised finger of a running figure in this sculpture, but that never actually happened--people just worried that it would happen.  This is located outside the old City Hall, which until recently housed the Davis Police Dept.  At that time many dubbed this statuary art, "Oh shit, it's the cops." Now this building will become a fancy restaurant in "Early 2005."  Maybe that statue will take on new significance.  Ah, living art.
 * ["The Dancing Pigs"] at ["The Marketplace"]
 * ["Stevenson Bridge"] located west of Davis
 * There is a big ["Scale"] over by ["Cruess Hall"]. More found art than anything else.

== Art that is no more ==

 * ["Davis Arch mural"]

Though much rarer than in a big city, Davis does see some ["Urban Art"].
