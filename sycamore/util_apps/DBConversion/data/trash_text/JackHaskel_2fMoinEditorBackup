The Dean Witter Fund will give you $12/person to take a professor out to lunch. No joke. The application form states that "Undergraduates will not be reinbursed for their own meal." So what's the point?

Get the form and read more about it [http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/PDF/form_Witter.pdf here (PDF)].
