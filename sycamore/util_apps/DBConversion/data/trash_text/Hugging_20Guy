Don't be afraid of the Hugging guy. He is a mentally handicapped 20-something year old man who hangs out around the ["MU"] and likes to hug people. Men and women alike. He isn't really creepy at all. He is just a friendly ["Town Characters" town character].

''I encountered Hugging Guy down at ["Pita Pit"] in early December. It was around 1:30 to 2 a.m., so it was mostly the post-bar crowd. He made the rounds giving everyone hugs. If I hadn't heard about him I might have been a little suspicious, but he was received surprisingly well by all the (confused and drunk) people he hugged. As stated, he wasn't creepy at all.. Just confusing. Good guy. --CaptainRush''

''I've seen and hugged this guy several times. Does anyone know where he lives?''-["AndreLipinski"]
