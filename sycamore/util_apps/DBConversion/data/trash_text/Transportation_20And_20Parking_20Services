Commonly known as TAPS, Transportation and Parking Services is in charge of general ["Transportation" transportation] issues on campus: collecting parking fees, issuing permits, ticketing violations, enforcing ''bike'' parking rules, and annoying students who don't pay for parking.  They are a University department -- not a private agency as some rumors suggest -- and make a good deal of money for the University.  Some of this money is transferred to ["Unitrans"], an ["ASUCD"] unit, because the bus service loses a lot of money.

Twice a year, TAPS organizes a ["Bike Auction"] to sell abandoned bikes on campus.  Typically, the bike officer goes around and looks for bikes left overnight a couple nights in a row.  The officer then puts up a tag, saying he'll remove the bike in one week.  He then goes around 6 days later with another tag, saying that there is 1 day to move the bike.  Then, after waiting another week, if the bike still has both tags on it, the University appropriates the bicycle and offers it up for auction.

TAPS hires a lot of students for enforcement and managing events.  If you're a sadist who loves inflicting fines on others, this job may be for you.  After all, TAPS is often accused of being the most Evil organization on campus.  People never call the ["California Regional Primate Research Center" Monkey Farm] evil, despite the fact that they're probably giving diseases to all of those poor primates.  But, being the selfish creatures we are, parking tickets are more objectionable to us.

=== Avoiding Fines ===
  * There are many ways to avoid getting citations from TAPS.  The most obvious way is to buy a permit.  The cost of a C permit is [http://taps.ucdavis.edu/parking/permits/rates.cfm pretty high], and day parking is $6. ["Parking Rates" Rates] have changed over the years.
  * Don't park in any staff lot ("A" Permit) until after 5PM, when all lots are available to all permits.
  * If you choose to park illegally, there are certain things you want to avoid doing:
    * Don't park illegally during finals week.  For some reason, they always step up enforcement during those weeks.
    * Don't park in a handicapped or Diamond-E (university vehicles only) space, as the fines are steeper and you're more likely to be checked.
    * Don't park in a "Deans Only" or "Vice Chancellors Only" spot.  You don't want them on your bad side.
    * If you've just been cited recently, you may want to pay for parking for a while.  They're not going to target you, but they might start to remember you.  Especially if your vehicle stands out from others.
    * Remember, citations are $30 each.  If you can park for free for more than five times, you've made your money back, in terms of daily permits.
=== Free Parking ===
  * There's actually some free parking on campus:
    * First, all parking between 10PM and 7AM is free in any lot, for late night studying.
    * All parking is free on the weekends ''unless'' there are TAPS people charging money for an event or event signs for that day.  In this case, go to another nearby lot for free parking.
    * There's a few 1-hour only spots near ["Shields Grove"], but it's pretty far from central campus.
    * There's also some free parking near the ["Mondavi Center"].
  * Otherwise, you may want to try parking downtown, though with all of the permits required and hour limits, that may be more trouble than it's worth.
  * Bike parking is always free :)  It's technically allowed in the general vicinity of any bike rack or wheel well.
