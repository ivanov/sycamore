Froggy's is an interesting place with an interesting history.  The short version of the history is below.  

Depending on the day of the week you see a completely different crowd.  But regardless of the day, you always see a blend of people who don't normally hang out together.  Often at the bar you see older locals who are playing dice.  You see a lot of country music fans and classic rock fans.  You also see a lot of various undergrads who are drawn in because there is never a cover, the bartenders pour generously, and the location is between ["Cantina del Cabo"], and diagonally across from ["G Street Pub"].  They have a jukebox which has a good selection, and an excellent happy hour.

== The Pond at Froggy's ==

Ivan and Cheryl of ["Hot Dogger"] fame recently acquired the kitchen at Froggy's, and so they have reinvented the restaurant formerly called Mike's Grill.  Judging by appearances, they are doing quite well in their latest business venture, because the place is generally crowded with customers eating Philly Cheesesteaks.  They actually serve fried Frog Legs here, too.  Leave a comment if you've tried them.

== History of the Paragon ==

Froggy's used to be called Paragon and they had an awesome wooden patio extending into the street.  Their kitchen was where Sophia of ["Sophia's Thai Kitchen"] fame, got her start.  

In their awesome patio, a UCD student named David Thornton was doing the birthday ritual 21 for 21 (consuming 21 drinks/shots).  This contributed to his tragic death, and Paragon was given a lot of the blame for not properly supervising its patio area.  Ultimately, they had to get rid of the patio, and the business had to change hands in order to remain a bar.  (Someone who knows more about this, please update this section.)
