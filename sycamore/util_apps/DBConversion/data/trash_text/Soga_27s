Food is good, but expensive.  We tried eating there three times.  Each time the service was abominable--worst I've ever had.  We have not been back.  --["BevSykes"]

I ate there the other evening with three friends.  Food was quite expensive; I wouldn't write home about it, either.  The drinks were excellent (though also expensive).  However I thought the service was excellent; prompt and curteous.  I guess it depends on which server you get.   --["KayRide"]
