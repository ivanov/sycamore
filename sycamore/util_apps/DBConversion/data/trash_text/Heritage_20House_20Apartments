Studio to two bedroom apartments. Very close to campus and affordable. 
The complex looks like a cheap hotel turned into residences. A pool lies in the middle of the property. Parking is somewhat limited, but gated.

------
I stayed in a 1Bed 1Bath apartment during the spring. The air conditioning unit was hard to control so it was either too cold or unbearably humid. The apartment itself is pretty old and shabby. The owner of the apartment said that she has seen ["Mice" mice] and ["Cockroaches" cockroaches] in and around the property. Positives include plenty of closet space and a separate and huge sink area in the bathroom. - ["LenaGranik"]
