These units are 2, 3, and 4 bedroom flats and townhouses. All units have either a balcony or a patio connected.  Sitting right across from ["Safeway"], these apartments are in a somewhat nice (for grocery shopping) location.  The phrase "sharps and flats" comes from the musical notion of sharp notes and flat notes, and this "theme" finds its way into every sign possible, unfortunately.

What kinda drags is the pool. You need to a key to get in and OUT, which is very strange.  PROTIP:  You can use a popsickle stick or basically anything to get the pool door open.  Just slide it through the side to unlock the door.  Sometimes the pool is pretty dirty.
 
   The pool is always clean in the summer and is one of the nicest pools I've seen in davis - ["KristenBirdsall"]

If you luck out and get an apartment here with no problems, they are really nice and spacy. They have a much better living room set up than ["Allegre"].  They feature "ThickAir" wireless internet access which is free for the first two residents and something like $10/month for the next two.  (The wireless had problems in Fall of 2004, but has since been working perfectly -- they now use MAC address filtering so you can't use their internet unless you register with them).

   The managment here sucks. If you like the ["South Davis" neighboorhood], I suggest ["Allegre"], since they are much more organized and on top of things. Sharps tends to take thier sweet ass time in fixing things, such as the garbage disposal with no blades:\ - ["JasminCamacho"]
