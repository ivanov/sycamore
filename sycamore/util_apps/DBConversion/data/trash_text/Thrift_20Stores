Davis offers an array of miscellaneous knick-knack shops, so check them out:

 * ["SPCA Thrift Store"]
 * ["All Things Right And Relevant"] (thrift) and ["R & R Thrift"] (consignment)
 * ["Bargain Barn"]
 * ["Salvation Army"] - Just went out of business
 * ["Re-Runs Thrift"]

''You can get this nifty map by asking for it at the ["SPCA Thrift Store"].''

There is also a fair number of thrift stores to be found by those who adventure north to ["Woodland"].

These include:

 * ["Yolo Hospice"]
 * ["Goodwill"]
 * ["Salvation Army Woodland"]
 * ["Thrift Store Outlet"] - A really good thrift store.  Tons of stuff can be found here for exceptionally low prices.  Because of the fact there's so many fashion-hip kids in Davis, a lot of the good stuff gets taken from the (very few) thrift stores in Davis.  On the whole, the same isn't true of ["Woodland"].  This store is in old-downtown ["Woodland"] on 106 West Main St.
