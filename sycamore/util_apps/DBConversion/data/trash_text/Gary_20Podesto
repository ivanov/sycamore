Gary Podesto was the Republican Mayor of ["Stockton"] who ran and lost against incumbent Democrat ["Mike Machado"] in a 2004 State Senate race. The race was the most expensive state legislative contest in United States history. Podesto raised $4.64 million, Machado $4.48 million. Also outside groups like Planned Parenthood and the California Farm Bureau added about $1 million which raised the grand total of the race to over $10 million. Even U.S Senate campaigns rarely reach $10 million, but a combination of a massive State Senate district and a lack of competitive seats around the state contributed to this astronomical fundraising figure. Both candidates heavily played up their ties to ["Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger"], while mutually accusing each other of water use 
mismanagment.

The heavily Democratic city of Davis was key to Machado's victory, having been redrawn into the contested 5th district since the last election.

At the time of the race, Davis was innudated daily with campaign literature and advertisements. The most memorable of these included rather bizzare television commericals featuring Gary Podesto, one in which he was the sheriff of a town in the wild west.

Gary Podesto is kind of freaky looking.  If I'm not mistaken, his campaign statements seemed to suggest that he wanted to make all of this senatorial district "all American" like Stockton.  I think all non-Stockton places are VERY happy they're not Stockton.  It's sad Mike Machado only won by a little.  Just goes to show what a well orchestrated smear-campaign can do.  Machado actually went to my house to ask us to vote for him.  I'm not sure what the strategy was in visiting solid-Democrat davis was, but maybe his internal polling showed Davisites as being duped into voting for creepy Podesto. - ["JaimeRaba" jr]

''2005-01-29 00:03:20'' [[nbsp]] The commercial of Gary Podesto as sheriff in the wild west made it look like he wasn't with the time.  Living in Stockton, I don't like seeing urban growth like we've been seeing.  After seeing the all the commercials each was bashing each other, I ended up not voting for either one.  A total disgrace even though I don't care for Machado anymore.  His office ignored my pleas for help with the worker's comp bill and all he does is send me a 3 page letter explaining his views.  Like that's suppose to make my herniated disc do away.  FUCK THEM ALL! --["JohnathanSmith"]------
''2005-01-29 15:36:36'' [[nbsp]] Well, here's the thing-- Podesto was heavily endorsed by Arnold.  I have no idea why the food4less founder and the austrian oak are so tight, but they are.  maybe arnold just hates Machado.  BUT that Sheriff commercial also got under my skin.  I mean, it looked like Podesto was trying to do what Arnold did--except in reverse.  Win an election by acting like a movie star, rather than win an election as a movie-star who acts like a politican.  Weird.  --["JaimeRaba"]
