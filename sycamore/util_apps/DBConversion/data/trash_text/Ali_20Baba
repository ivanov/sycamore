Ali Baba's is a wonderful little Middle Eastern restaurant very close to campus, right across from ["Cafe Roma"] (Campus Roma) on 3rd Street.  During lunch times the place gets packed -- and rightfully so!  ["Ali Baba"]'s has amazing burgers (cheeseburgers especially), cheap lunch specials that fill you to the brim, and seemingly only attractive female employees.

The (owners?) regulars are always relaxing inside, playing backgammon against each other.  Ali Baba's is perhaps the backgammon capital of the area.

The daily specials run a little under $5, are ready in an instant, and taste very good.  Make sure you mix in the yogurt they give you -- it's delicious!  Also, you can order a half-order of the specials that runs much cheaper and gives you nearly as much food -- they give you as much sauce but less rice.

Offering similar items (but different) is ["Sam's Mediterranean"], which is literally a block away, also on 3rd.  Ali Baba's is more popular, but the cook at ["Sam's Mediterranean"] is said to be nicer.  There are ["Sam's Mediterranean"] people, and there are Ali Baba's people.

Interestingly, Ali Baba's offers ["WiFi Hot Spots" wireless internet].  They have a red ["hot sauce"] that you can put on the rice to kick it up a bit.

''2004-11-15 21:56:20'' [[nbsp]] I went to Al Baba's the other day and ordered a Veggie Mushroom Cheese Burger and they gave me a couple strips of Bacon. I took a bite and lets just say, not only do I keep kosher but i've been a vegetarian for over eight years. I waited for another burger and I barely got an apology. They seemed pissed off about me saying they messed up my order. they have great food when they make it right but when i fuck up a customers order i offer them something extra to make it up to them. Basically they should have given me some fries.  - ["RobRoy"]------
