'''CONSTRUCTION START:''' 02/12/2004  '''CONSTRUCTION END:''' 06/29/2005 ([http://www.ae.ucdavis.edu/projweb/projweb.nsf/0/64A3A50F45CD05EF88256DCE005E2702/$FILE/9502600MSB.pdf source])

(Construction End is likely projected and is also not at all indicative of when people will be using the building.)

Sandwiched between ["Academic Surge"], Engineering III and the ["Crocker Nuclear Lab"], this new facility for the Mathematics and Statistics department is cloaked in shadow and mystery, by which I mean there wasn't an article about it in the UCD Staff newspaper so I've got nothing on it, man.

This is basically where ["Kerr Hall"] is moving. But then who-so-ever will be inhabiting ["Kerr Hall"]? More mystery!

You can [http://webcam.math.ucdavis.edu watch] a ["Web cams" web cam] of this building as it's being constructed!
