Feel free to nominate pages you would like to see ["Featured Page" featured] on the ["Front Page"] and '''post a short writeup with a photo'''.  Separate the nominees with a line break.

There are so so many awesome pages.  Somebody ought to write up a featured page for something -- anything -- because I'm getting tired of the ["Fog"] one :0) --["PhilipNeustrom"]
-----
I think ["Good Ideas For Dates"] should be the featured page. Most of us student users are far away from Davis during the vacation.  It is one page that we could still work on. It would spur on the creation of new pages as well.
  * Find a cool picture and write it up :)
  * I think this would be a great featured page!  Can someone find a nice image that communicates "fun date" so we can make this happen?

["fistulated cow"]!!! -- ["ArlenAbraham"]
-----

I think ["University Construction"] should be a featured page sometime soon.  It's got a lot of awesome potential.  If I still had a digital camera I'd run around and take update photos of all the pages (which look a lot different than they did when most of the current pictures were taken).  Also, there's a lot of places completely lacking photos. But it's got ''potential'', kiddo.  - ["PhilipNeustrom"]

Personally I am rather intriged by the tunnels on campus. Maybe the Feature Page could be changed weekly, with different people being in charge of each week. I like the fistulated cow and construction ideas too and I think more ideas similar are the way to go. -["AshleyOrsaba"]
-----
Yeah those are cool ideas too, the only reason I suggested the Fog was I thought it was cool having the Featured Page relevant to current events like ["Procrastinating"] during finals week. But ANYTHING is fine, I just think we need to take down the shooting deal cause now its old news. -["JamesDawe"]
-----
Like the top of this page suggests, write up a short hook, include an appropriate image, and post it here!  Then we can edit it to perfection and post it.  The photos should be scaled down to around 320 pixels for the largest dimension. - ["MikeIvanov"]

With the [http://www.sacbee.com/content/politics/story/11923186p-12810236c.html death of Congressman Robert Matsui (CA, 5th district)], and an upcoming [http://www.sacbee.com/content/politics/ca/story/11923200p-12810241c.html special election], we wonder whether ["Michael Dugas" Mike Dugas], his challenger in the election that just passed will run again. ["Michael Dugas" Stay tuned...]
  * I think this is cool.  Is there actual speculation that he will run?  Anyone else have any input? I'm sick of the current featured page so feel free to change it w/a bit more input.  --["PhilipNeustrom"]
  *  Thanks for changing the featured page, Ken.  --["PhilipNeustrom"]

["fistulated cow"]. -- ["JaimeRaba" jr]

It's winter. The featured page should be ["Snow Sports"] (hoping that a picture or two gets uploaded to it). -- ["GiladGurantz"]
  * I definitely agree.  If anyone has a cool photo of a snowboard or something, then upload it to that page and do a writeup.  I think it'd be a great featured page.  (though it needs a bit more of a non-hidden reference to ["SOS"], the largest club on campus. --["PhilipNeustrom"]

Time for a new page. I (["KenBloom"]) suggest:

||http://www.daviswiki.org/dwiki/data/pages/Quad_20Phone_203/attachments/quadphone3.jpg|| Need to make a phone call, but don't have a cell phone? Or do you just feel like having some fun and really confusing someone? Either way, check out the ["Payphone Project"]. (This photo is ["Quad Phone 3"])||
  * This was actually done before.  How about ["Micromouse"]?:

||attachment:micromouse_thumb.jpg||<valign="top"> The micromouse design project is an annual competition wherein ["UC Davis"] students attempt to build a small, autonomous, robot capable of traversing an unknown maze.  Check out ["Micromouse"]!||
  * Might be able to say more, but that's what I first came up with.
    * Excellent - let's give it a couple days to make sure nobody has any reason to object to it, then we can post it. -- ["KenBloom"]
-----
We should do ["Good Ideas For Dates"] in early February. -- ["KenBloom"]
 * I agree with Ken on this one. But after V-day I say we have ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"] as the featured page for about 10 days. -- ["RobRoy"]
   * I disagree. It would look like (be?) an endorsement and we shouldn't be endorsing anybody. -- ["KenBloom"] Seconded ["JackHaskel"]
     * Although one may say it is endorsement. It is the only ASUCD Senate slate that actively uses the wiki. It would be contextual for the elections. Also, a founding member of the Wiki is running on the slate, as well as a founding member's brother and a founding member's girlfriend. And Ken, you are the one that put the Mike Dugus page up. ;) -["RobRoy"]
       * Mike and Philip created the wiki, Paul provided some initial ideas.
       * The Mike Dugas situation is different: (a) he didn't run in our district (i.e. nobody in the city can actually vote for him), (b) it was after his race ended, and even though I discussed speculation that he might run, I really doubt it. (c) it sat on ["Next Featured Page"] for a while, and nobody complained about the idea. However, I'll take that as a complaint and be more careful about such things next time.

       As for the other reasons you mention, the only one that I feel has any relevance is the fact that it would be contextual for elections. If you feel the need to advertise ASUCD elections on this site too, then we can feature ["Senate Candidates"] and ["Presidential Candidates"] (and also any ballot measures that may occur). -- ["KenBloom"]
         * I think this is a good idea.  We should hope to have information on all candidates.  People should know that others are ''most'' likely to vote for them when they see they are better through reason (At least if they're sitting on a computer looking at this site). ''Also, Ken, I think the Dugas page was fine -- though I don't agree with his politics, he is a UC Davis figure and I thought it was cool he'd run for Congress''

I changed the featured page to ["Sword and Sandals"] w/o saying anything here first because I ''really'' want to go to sleep right now but I wanted it to be the Featured page for folks when they wake up in the morning.  --["PhilipNeustrom"]
