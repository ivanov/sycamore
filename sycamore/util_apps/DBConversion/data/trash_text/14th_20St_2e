14th Street is fairly short and runs from ["F St." F street] up to ["Oak Ave." Oak Avenue], at which time it becomes ["Villanova Dr."].  Houses and ["St James Catholic Church"] line the south side and ["North Davis School"], [http://www.yolocounty.org/org/library/ the Yolo County Library], ["Veterans Memorial Building"], and ["Davis Senior High School"] line the north side.

["Parkside Apartments"] are at the far east end of 14th St (F and 14th), going through Parkside parking lot will take you to ["H St."] where you can access the ["H St. Bike Tunnel"] which runs under the ["train tracks"] and connects ["H St."] with ["Pine Crest Apartments"] on ["J St."]. This is an excelent alternative to walking/biking all the way up/down to ["Covell"]/["8th St."] to cross the tracks.
