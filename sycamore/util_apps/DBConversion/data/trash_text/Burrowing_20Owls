Burrowing Owls are native to California's Central Valley, and unlike other owls of the area, they live underground. However, Burrowing Owls don't dig burrows themselves, but instead reuse abandoned ground-squirrel and other mammal holes. Burrowing Owls are diurnal, feed on insects and rodents, and normally produce 4-5 young a year. They are also exceedingly loyal to their nests, preferring to maintain a continuous home. Burrowing Owls are currently threatened due to development encroaching onto the agricultural land they inhabit.
