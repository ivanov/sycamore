 * ["Chipotle"] - '''Free''' small drink with any burrito or tacos.  Just show your ["Reg Card"].
 * ["Absolute Cellular"] - Some nebulous "UCD student discount."
 * ["Next G Wireless"] - $200 or $250 dollars off of 'online pricing'(?), free accessory value package and additional rebates to make purchasing a ["Cellular Phone" cell phone] inexpensive.
 * ["Yolobus"] - Everyone knows that UCD undergrads can ride Unitrans for free (well-- they technically pay for this privilege with their ASUCD fees), but what is less well known is that undergrads can ride [http://www.yolobus.com/ Yolobus] for ''free'' also .. just flash your student ID.  Note that Grad/professional students don't pay ASUCD fees, so they have to pay full fare for Yolobus (and Unitrans).
     

== Graduate / Professional Students ==

 * ["Unitrans"] - Grad/professional students don't pay ASUCD fees, so they have to pay full fare.
     * Grad/professional sudents can get a discount on Unitrans passes from TAPS if they do not have a parking permit. E.g., A 10-ride pass that normally costs $5 will cost only $3.
     * Grad students ''could'' ride the bus free by electing to pay ASUCD fees.  Also rumored to happen: using a marker to put the magic blue dot on their card [this is illegal], or deftly flashing their card and hoping the driver doesn't notice the absense of a blue dot [ethically questionable].  At a certain point, it becomes more efficient just to pay ASUCD fees.
