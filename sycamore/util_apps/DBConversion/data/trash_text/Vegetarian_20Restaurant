In the heart of Walmart-infested, Republican-voting Woodland lies a Vietnamese restaurant called "NV Vegetarian Restaurant."  Who knows what the NV stands for, since it is left off most places.  (Non-meat Vietnamese?)  You'd think there would be a ["Vegetarian Options" Vegetarian] restaurant in Davis.  Of course, you'd think there'd be a ["Night Time" 24-hour] restaurant in Davis too.  Does Davis hate students and vegetarians?  Write ["City Council"] and find out.
