'''Men Acting Against Rape (MAAR)''' 

(From MAAR's website)
'''Mission Statement''' 

Men Acting Against Rape (MAAR) is a comprehensive organization whose primary focus is to decrease the prevalence of sexual assaults, rapes and violent acts against women on campus at ["Campus" UC Davis]. Our goals will be realized through various outlets of expression, outreach and education. With the proper guidance and outlook, MAAR will succeed in disseminating the knowledge necessary to prevent the perpetuation of these acts, and ideally, create a network of like institutions that have a similar focus in order to more fully augment the world's understanding of sexual violence and what can be done to prevent it. We intend to help males realize that their strength is not for hurting, and that they too can help to end this violent plague that affects all of our lives.
