(the following description is from the ["Town Art"] page):

Town folklore has it that some hapless passerby tripped and suffered some injury upon the upraised finger of a running figure in this sculpture, but that never actually happened—people just worried that it would happen. Originally the sculpture was a few feet closer to the intersection of 3rd and F, but after heated debate over possible injury from the aforementioned finger, the sculpture was moved a few feet back to its present location.

This is located outside the old City Hall, which until recently housed the Davis Police Department (and previously, the Fire Department as well). At that time many dubbed this statuary art, "Oh shit, it's the cops." Now this building will become a fancy restaurant in "Early 2005." Maybe that statue will take on new significance. Ah, living art.
