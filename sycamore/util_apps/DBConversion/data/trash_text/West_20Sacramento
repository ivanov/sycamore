West Sacramento is city unto itself, rather than a subdivision of ["Sacramento"].  Immediately after crossing the ["Yolo Causeway" causeway] begins West Sacramento, part of ["Yolo County"].  West Sacramento used to be part of Sacramento County and was formerly the westmost part of Sacramento (as you might expect).  However, they broke off and joined Yolo county, after feeling like the city and county of Sacramento was basically allowing West Sacramento to fall apart. 

West Sacramento has improved signficantly in recent years, and may soon be home to "box stores" useful to Davis-dwellers.  Plans have been announced for a Home Depot, Ikea, as well as other large retailers.  But for now, the city is mostly significant because of its ["Denny's"] only about 7 miles from ["South Davis"].  

The ["Rivercats"] minor league baseball team also has its stadium in West Sacramento.  The city is also home to "The Dude Motel".
