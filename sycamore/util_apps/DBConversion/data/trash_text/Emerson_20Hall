Emerson Hall is a fine dorm situated just Northwest of campus. It is part of the ["Cuarto"] area. Living situation is suite-style, with 4-6 people to a suite. Sometimes crazy things end up in the pool, like shopping carts, road signs, fish, or bicycles. ["Freshmen"] have ''way'' too much time on their hands..

''A few years ago, it looked like this on the inside:''

''I assume it probably looks about the same now.''

Emerson is home to several theme programs, including the Science Academic Theme Program and the Health Science Academic Theme Program, as well as the soon-to-be-extinct Outdoor Experience Floor. All are located on "Grass Side" of Emerson (the side without the pool).
