Orchard Park is one of two campus-managed apartment complexes located on campus.  Apartments are tiny, very basic, and cheap, but the complex has a large courtyard and two playgrounds for children as well as laundry facilities and a community center available to all leaseholders. If you have children, both Orchard and Solano Parks are nice because there are so many other people with children; neighbors often help each other out with babysitting and the [http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/Current/Parks/default.htm community] offers lots of after-school programs to entertain kids and provide family support. There is a nearby Child Development Center that, I believe, offers a discount to families living in either Orchard or Solano Park. Only two bedroom apartments are available and the waiting list is extensive and prioritized in the following order: 

||1) Students with children, ||
||2) Married students/domestic partnerships - documentation required, ||
||3) Graduate students no children, ||
||4) Undergraduate students no children||
