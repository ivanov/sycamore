The "I-House" provides services to foreign students, scholars and visitors.  Over 40 groups from UCDavis and Sacramento use the International House.  Its purpose, as stated on the official website is to " promote respect and appreciation for all peoples and cultures and to work for world peace".

Nobody knows how many people have been tempted to add "OF PANCAKES" to the title on the building.
