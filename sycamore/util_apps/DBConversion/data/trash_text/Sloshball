During spring, there are Sloshball games about three times a week at ["Manor Park or Slide Hill Park" Slide Hill Park]. Sloshball is played very much like your typical softball or kickball rules but with a few twists:

 * Instead of a second base, there is a keg of beer. It's usually something college-y and cheap. Like ["Natural Ice"]
 * To determine who's home and/or away the two captains chug a beer. Winner get's to choose.
 * When people reach second base after batting the only way to move on to third is to finish a beer. At this point there are two variations to the game.
       * '''Chug Rules:''' Each runner must chug a beer while at the keg before the next runner reaches second or else it is considered an out.
       * '''Normal Rules:''' When a runner reaches second they may stay there until they finish their beer and more than one runner is allowed on second base.


== Annual Sloshball Games ==

 * Every year there is the infamous sloshball game between ["The California Aggie"] and ["ASUCD"]. Last year, the game was canceled due to the ["Senator Ackerman Scandal"] and other tensions between the organizations. Two years ago, however, ["The California Aggie" The Aggie] got trounced by ["ASUCD"].
 * ["SOS"] has their annual ["Picnic Day"] sloshball game (mandatory chug rules) after most of the normal festivities are over. This game usually gets pretty rowdy (last year it ended up in wrestling and keg stands) for many old school ["SOS"] staff and officers show up for the annual event.

 *Add more...I know there are more.


During spring, there are Sloshball games about three times a week at ["Manor Park or Slide Hill Park" Slide Hill Park]. This is probably because ["Open Container Ordinance" open containers are allowed] and there is an awesome cement slide.
