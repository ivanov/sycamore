Castilian Hall is one of the ["Cuarto"] area ["Dorms"].  Like other ["Cuarto"] buildings, Castilian is not located on ["Campus"] like other ["Freshmen"] living areas, but is located on ["Wake Forest Dr."] close to ["8th St."].

Castilian has its own ["Dining Commons"] in addition to the nearby Oxford Circle ["Dining Commons"]. Castilian Hall is divided into two halves: Castilian North and Castilian South. Both feature their own pools, spas, and laundry rooms, with the only difference being the proximity of Castilian South to the ["Dining Commons"] and its game area. Each carpeted and air-conditioned unit in Castilian is actually a suite with a living room, one or two bathrooms, and anywhere from two to four bedrooms. Each suite can accommodate up to twelve students and the residence hall houses a total of 450 students.

It's easy to feel like Castilian is really just a big ["Apartments" apartment complex], and that's because it used to be one!  The ["UC Davis" University] purchased the then-apartment complex off of someone and outfitted it to be a ["Dorms" residence hall].  You can see photos of the old apartment-style setup in the main area where the ["Resident Advisors" RA] desk is.
