Southern California is characterised by good ethnic food, smog, "freeway culture," urban sprawl, 24-hour shopping and, of course, the beach. Although the minority, a significant number of Southern California students make the trek northward to attend ["Campus" UC Davis].

Percentage of Student Body from some Southern Californian Counties: ([http://why.ucdavis.edu/facts_figures.cfm source])
  *8.2% Los Angeles
  *4.0% San Diego



Southern California's generally considered to be everything south of the Grapevine, (although some Northern Californians believe otherwise, even, in extremis, holding it to be "everything south of San Jose.")
Geographically, it can be thought of as several distinct regions:
 * Los Angeles area. This doesn't just mean the city of LA, but also the whole LA basin, Orange County, San Fernando, etc.
 * North of Los Angeles. This means everything in Ventura/Oxnard/Thousand Oaks and in the Santa Barbara area. North of Santa Barbara is generally no longer considered to be in Southern CA, but rather ["Central California"].
 * South of Los Angeles. I generally think of Los Angeles stopping at about the point that interstate 5 hits the coast (i.e. San Juan Capistrano/Dana Point), but some people also think of Camp Pendelton as being the southern barrier against LA. Anything south of here is generally separate, and is really more San Diego than LA.
 * East of Los Angeles.  Beyond Riverside lies desert.  People play golf there, I'm told.

'''Los Angeles'''

This is often what people think of first when they think of Southern California. It is characterized by massive urban sprawl, smog, lots and lots of stuff to do, and many excellent places to eat. It is also really, really varied. If you spend some time in Santa Monica, some time in Pasadena and some time in Irvine, you'll have been in three really different towns, but most people lump all three into the "LA" label. Generally, LA is a good place to get a job, but also an expensive place to live. Also, the further inland you go, the worse the smog. By the time you get to Riverside, the ocean is a distant memory, and the smog is a constant companion. Housing can be as little as $200,000 for a house (probably less in some areas), to over several million dollars for a single 1/2 acre of undeveloped land. It all depends on where you are looking, but basically, expect things to be expensive. Also, expect traffic to be bad, but not as bad as in the Silicon Valley area. Also, don't expect to bike anywhere. If you do, people will honestly think you are nuts. Really.

LA is the home of the "freeway culture". Other parts of Southern CA may have aspects of it, but LA is its spiritual home.  "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" is an entertaining, somewhat fictionalized treatment of the subject.

'''North of Los Angeles'''

North of LA, I generally think of as two areas: The Ventura and Santa Barbara areas. The Ventura area is larger, and more spread out. It encompasses Ventura, Oxnard, Camarillo, Thousand Oaks, and several other areas. It has a LOT of good beaches, and plenty of places to surf. Its also generally considered to still be a fairly affordable place to live (although it is getting costly in some areas). Some parts of the Ventura area still have a small town feel, but also the area is slowly succumbing to sprawl and big box malls. Also, there are parts of the Ventura area, especially Oxnard, that have quite a gang presence.

North of Ventura, you've got the Santa Barbara area. This is one of the nicest towns that I've ever been to (disclaimer, I grew up there -["EricKlein" ek]). It is also insanely expensive. It generally has some of the highest gas prices in the state, and hands down, has the most expensive home prices in the state. Last time I checked, median home prices were about $1 million for a modest tract home. The cost is largely because development is frozen in the area. There is no room to expand, and the locals like it that way. They are very afraid of turning into LA, so they limit growth as much as they can. The mountains on one side, the ocean on another, a coastal preserve on another, and a narrow connecting corridor (between cliffs and ocean) to Ventura on the other hem Santa Barbara in on all sides. The only development happening in Santa Barbara these days is either redevelopment of old property, or the very rare development of old preserved land. As often as not these days, the old preserved land is being bought by land trusts to preserve the land as a natural habitat so that it cannot be developed. Developers who are under intense community pressure often sell land that they had planned to build homes on to these land trusts. The final result is a very nice town that has mostly kept its small town charm, but is also too expensive for most people to live in. Because of this, many middle class families (and jobs) are leaving the area, and the people left are either (a) rich retirees, (b) twenty and thirty somethings willing to live several people to a house, or the odd family that has lived there for decades.

If you can afford to live there, Santa Barbara provides excellent beaches and surfing. It is also a great place for ["Bicycling" biking], providing lots of flat and mountainous terrain. Oh, and there are a LOT of really good restaurants here, whether you like authentic mexican, american mexican, or something that isn't even remotely mexican.

'''South of Los Angeles'''

The San Diego area generally has the best overall weather of Southern CA. It's usually sunny and relatively warm all year. Downtown San Diego is quite nice, and overall, the San Diego sprawl is much more courteous and restrained than the LA sprawl. San Diego still has a lot of Navy/Marine influence in town, and if you spend much time there, it's hard not to notice it. As with many large cities, there are quite a few things to do, but I highly recommend both the zoo and the wild animal park.

LA is growing in the general direction of San Diego, it should be noted.
