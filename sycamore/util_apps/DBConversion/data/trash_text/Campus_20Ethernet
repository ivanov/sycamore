You '''must''' have your NIC (the code on your Ethernet card) registered with UC Davis.  To do this, you must be a UCD student or somehow have a UCD login/password.  If you lived in the dorms, you likely did this.  If not, it's painless -- just go to [http://computingaccounts.ucdavis.edu] and click on "Ethernet (NIC) registration."

 * Around the ["Memorial Union"] (especially in the study lounges)
 * ["Shields Library"] all over.
 * ["Health Sciences Library"] and ["Physical Sciences Library"]
 * Classrooms:
   * There is a [http://av.ucdavis.edu/tcpip/dhcpclassrooms.cgi list of classrooms] with Ethernet plugs, but generally:  just hunt around.
