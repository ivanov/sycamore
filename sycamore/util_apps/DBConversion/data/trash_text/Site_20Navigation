Additionally, {{{[[TableOfContents]]}}} will generate a table of contents for the page based on the headlines in the page (play with it).

So that means if I segment my page like this:

= Headline 1 =
blah blah.  blah blah.
== Subheadline ==
text here!
= Headline 2 =
more text

then if I include {{{[[TableOfContents]]}}} I get:
[[TableOfContents]]

and those are links to those sections in the text.  Nifty!
