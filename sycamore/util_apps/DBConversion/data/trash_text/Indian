Indian food is delicious, often spicy, and has many dishes to suit either a meat-eater's or ["Vegetarian Options" vegetarian's] palate. It is available in Davis from the ["Kathmandu Kitchen"] booth at the ["Farmers Market"] and the restaurant location. 

Indian food is also available at ["Raja's"] next to campus. 

Both places offer lunch buffets.

I, ["George Andrews"], happen to be both Indian and spicy. Futhermore I live in Davis. Therefore it's totally legit for me to stake a claim here. BAM - ["GeorgejAndrews"]
