Round Table Pizza is a ["Restaurants" pizza chain] located in the north-east corner of ["Oakshade Town Center"], just off of ["Pole Line Rd."] It offers dine-in, carry-out, and delivery. 

Once upon a time, Round Table was downtown, where Kathmandu Kitchen is now. It went out of business, remained in restaurant heaven for quite some time, and then finally re-emerged in the Davis food scene when Oakshade was developed. It serves pizza, but if you want quality, try ["Woodstock's Pizza" Woodstock's], ["Steve's Place Pizza" Steve's], or the ["Symposium" Symposium].
