''The Downtown Starbucks, between Tower Records and The Posh Bagel''

There are slightly over three Starbucks in Davis.

One is in ["Central Davis"], in the ["University Mall"].  It's the closest coffee to the ["Cuarto"] dorms.  This means that if you're a Freshman in those dorms you'll probably head over there a lot.  The place is usually really packed, and everyone studys there.  If you'd rather chat it up, check out the ["Old Teahouse"] next door.

The other is ["Downtown"] on F Street.  It's got less studying going on, but that's mainly because most of the seats are outside.

The third full Starbucks (with a drive-thru!) is newly opened near the ["Sutter Hospital"] in ["West Davis"].

A fractional Starbucks is located in ["South Davis"] ["Safeway"]. One could argue that it is not, in fact, a true Starbucks, though it does feature an employee in a genuine Starbucks uniform serving genuine Starbucks beverages. However, as it is a mere supermarket booth kiosk contraption, there is of course no place to sit. This is the Starbucks one might utilize if one finds oneself in the ["South Davis"] ["Safeway"] with a strong craving for expensive coffee.

The Starbucks workers ''inside'' of ["Safeway"] are actually Safeway employees trained by Starbucks (and sometimes/always work exclusively at the coffee bar.)  However, because they are Safeway employees they receive union benefits such as (slightly) greater pay and occasional paid time off.


Other fractional Starbucks exist in the ["ARC"], ["Scrubs" Scrubs Cafe], and the ["Silo"].
