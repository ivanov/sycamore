A list of 25 random pages (out of [[PageCount]] total):[[RandomPage(25)]]


* ''Not 100% sure this page should be editable.  Since it is, I'll add feedback -- it would be nice to have a 'Random Page' page where the pages returned exclude user profiles (since many are too minimal to read).  If that's done, the inverse 'Random User' page would be handy as well.  -- ["JabberWokky" jw]''
 * ''That's a good idea.  For now, I think you can use {{{[[RandomQuote(People)]]}}} for 'Random User' functionality'' -- ["MikeIvanov" Mike Ivanov]
