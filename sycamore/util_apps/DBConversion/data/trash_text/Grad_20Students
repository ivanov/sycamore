Graduate Students are students who are pursuing a Master's or Doctorate degree (if not both).  There are a few thousand of them in Davis.  Since graduate school isn't really about taking a set number of units and requirements vary by department, they have been known to stick around for a long time.  That is, until they get sick of school or funding runs out.  To figure out when a grad student will graduate, ask him or her how long until they're done.  Then multiply this value by 1.5 to get a good estimate.

Grad Students are members of ["GSA"]. Many of them are also ["Teaching Assistants"].

You can recognize them by the fact that they are too busy with "work" to describe themselves in the Davis Wiki.  They're generally more dissheveled looking than undergraduate students, as they're more concerned with academics than appearance.
