The locomotive hedge is parked on G Street right next to ["The Davis Enterprise"] corporate office (which is next to ["Jack in the Box"]).  

You'd probably never see this unless it was pointed out to you, because when you walk by it looks like a normal hedge (head-on, that is).  ''But from the side...''

It jumps out!  A freaking '''train''', sitting right there on G Street!

And in the spring and summer, when it's trimmed, they have (or used to!) a porpoises-and-whales-arcing hedge next to the parking lot at Old Davis Road and 1st street -- next to the daycare.

Note as of December 1, 2005: the hedge seems to have been pretty much destroyed- there's not enough bushes left to form a train any more. Bummer.
