=About=
Graciela Guardado, aka "Grace", is a fifth year double majoring in Studio Art and ["Religious Studies"] with a minor in Film Studies. You may have seen her in the past five years driving you to school in a ["Unitrans"] bus, serving you ["Coffee House"] food or maybe you thought she was giving you a dirty look since she lacks social skills. She currently works as a graphic designer for ["Unitrans"]. She also holds the positions of Student Life Editor and Design Editor for the ["El Rodeo"] Yearbook. 

In a past life she was a dj at ["KDVS"] starting in the fall of 2001 through the end of summer 2003. Her dj name was Gideon and her show was titled ''Augmented Fifth: Music for Thought''. She also had a brief stint as music director during the beginning of the 2002-2003 academic year. Her last show aired on a Thursday in Septemeber of 2003. She hasn't gone back since.

Graciela also contributed graphics to the ["California Aggie"] under the watchful eye of Fitz Vo during the 2002-2003 academic year. She is dissapointed with the current state of graphics in the Aggie and would like the person responsible for those graphics to learn how to use Adobe Illustrator. 

She is an aspiring illustrator and will one day vector her way into the San Francisco design firm Templin Brink.
