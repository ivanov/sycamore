Hello!

I’m writing to invite you to check out DavisWiki.org 

DavisWiki is a place to record Davis culture, places, spots — everything! This is an experiment in community and a project that will be fruitful for years to come.

Anyone can edit the wiki. Anyone can contribute, change, and add without knowing anything about websites. Most websites you go to are static — you only read them. This is a very different place.

DavisWiki has already become a stupendous success. At the moment over 600 unique visitors use the site each day! That makes it the best place to find out what is going on in Davis. 

If you are interested in leaving your mark on the fastest-growing community resource in Davis or simply want to learn more about our beautiful city, come visit DavisWiki.org

Have a great day!

 * ''Stress that it gets better the more people contribute/diversity of opinion?  Also, bragging about hits is lamesauce because most people have no idea how that sort of thing translates.  I think if you're going to get people on thefacebook and listservs to know about it you should try to slightly personalize the message -- e.g. mention a topic that they would be interested in?''
