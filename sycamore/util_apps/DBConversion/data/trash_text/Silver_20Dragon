''Although it looks like a fucking diner, Silver Dragon is, in fact, a chinese restaurant.  That's about all you need to know about it, seeing as there is really no reason to go here.  If you want buffet, hit up ["Great Wall"].  If you want a little nicer food (not to mention atmosphere) go to ["Noodle Express"].

If you want to feel like you're at a truck stop, eat at Silver Dragon.'' - ["JeremyAbramson"]

''I've been to this place a couple times, and I had pretty good food.  It sort of '''is''' a diner, so I don't think the look really matters.  Sure, I wouldn't take a girl there on a date, but it's not awful or anything.  Personally, my favorite Chinese place in town is ["Hunan"].  I would suspect a lot of people like Silver Dragon because the place always has a lot of customers?'' - ["PhilipNeustrom"]

''Chinese restaurant?  Last I was there, I didn't see anyone working there that spoke chinese.  Some of my relatives are bent on speaking chinese as much as possible and they didn't find that there.  The food was... edible I guess.  I recommend ["Orange Hut"]'' - ["MarieHuynh"]

'''Silver Dragon's general chicken totally wins''' - ["TheRadish"]
 * ''Haha, you sound so white :P'' - ["MarieHuynh"]
 * ''The sad thing is that arguably the most authentic Chinese food in Davis can be gotten at ["Old Teahouse"], in terms of selection and serving food without sweet sauces, although this says little about quality.  For those who truly love '''authentic''' Chinese cuisine, it's hard to do much better than ["New Canton"]. Its Chinese name is something like "Towards the Wind," just to be random, and it is located on Broadway & 26th in ["Sacramento"].  Chef Tony Su, used to be Executive Chef at ABC in Milpitas, the best Chinese restaurant in the northern half of California (sharing this honor with Hong Kong Flower Lounge in Millbrae).'' - ["JaimeRaba" jr]

''There is a bit of Davis history available here if you look for it; take a close look at the decor the next time you go in. Look for the steers with the capitol T on their foreheads. The tables and chairs have the logo of the restaurant that was there before Silver Dragon. Their lunch offerings are good.'' - ["JasonAller"]
