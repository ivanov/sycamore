The '''Plant and Environmental Sciences''' (PES) Building is squished in between the ["Tennis Courts"] to the North, ["Veihmeyer Hall"] to the South, and ["Hunt Hall"] to the East. The three-story building houses faculty from the departments of Agronomy and Range Science; Land, Air and Water Resources; Environmental Science and Policy; and Environmental Horticulture.
