The Physical Sciences Library, or more properly, the Physical Sciences ''and Engineering'' Library is home to all the technical volumes that were too cool for ["Shields Library"]. Located just South of the ["Chemistry"] building and East of ["Roessler Hall" Roessler], this is the best library to study in if you need '''ABSOLUTE SILENCE'''. Here you will find ["engineering students"] doing what they do best: being quiet and getting their shit ''done''. It also has some pretty ["Cleanest Bathrooms" sweet bathrooms] (and by sweet, I mean eat-my-carl's-jr.-off-the-bowl '''clean''').
