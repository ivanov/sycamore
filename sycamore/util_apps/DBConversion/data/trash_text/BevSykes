||<^(>[[BR]][[BR]]I am one of the ["Mature Davisites"] and one of the newer "old timers."  We moved here in 1973 and lived in ["West Davis"].  Now we live in ["Central Davis"], though we still live in the same house.  That's how big Davis has grown in 31 years. [[BR]][[BR]]We raised five children here, two of whom are buried in the ["Davis Cemetery"].  At one time they were familiar figures at the ["Veterans Memorial Theatre"] because they performed with ["Acme Theatre Co."], ["Davis Senior High School"] and with  ["The Band Lawsuit"], which was quite popular around here for about 10 years.  Two of the kids performed with ["Davis Musical Theatre Co."] in its early years.  Most of our kids, at one time or another, worked at the ["Veterans Memorial Theatre"].  [[BR]][[BR]]My husband works for the US Agriculture Department, and in his spare time, volunteers with the ["Davis Comic Opera Co."] as its Technical Director.||<^|3>attachment:BevSykes.jpg||






=Work/Volunteer=

Years ago, I worked for ["The Secretariat"] and the now-defunct Typing Company.  I've also worked for ["Sutter West Women's Health"] and ["Caring for Women"].  Now, I do medical transcription at home, review shows for ["The Davis Enterprise"] and volunteer with the ["SPCA"] newsletter.  

Within the gay community I volunteer at the annual ["Gay Pride Day"] picnic and with ["Marriage Equality California"]. I spend a lot of time at the ["Dog Park"] in ["Community Park"].

=Hobbies=

I love computers and do a lot of basic (not complicated) web design.  I'm also into digital photography and am currently obsessed with learning PhotoShop.

I belong to ["Physical Edge"], but don't work out nearly as often as I should.  At one time I loved ["Bicycling"] until I had an accident which has prevented me from riding my bike for the past two years. 

In my spare time, I do continuing battle with Davis' ever-present ["Ants" ants]

=On the Web=

I have a personal web site at [http://dcn.davis.ca.us/go/basykes] and keep a daily on-line journal at [http://www.funnytheworld.com].

''2004-12-14 15:49:50'' [[nbsp]] You didn't list "This is Spinal Tap" on your bit about the Christopher Guest movies. Another classic :) - ["KenNeville"]------
''2004-12-14 16:52:05'' [[nbsp]] Believe it or not, I've never seen Spinal Tap. - ["BevSykes"]------
''2004-12-14 17:27:36'' [[nbsp]] It's a good movie.  There are many inside music jokes, but it's accessable, similar to Best in Show having jokes that are dog lovers or dog show jokes but also being very accessable. - ["JabberWokky"]

''2004-12-27 06:51:34'' [[nbsp]] Hey Bev, I love your additions to the Mount Rushmore page. It amuses me that Gary Saylin and Bob Dunning have a feud going on. Dunning has mentioned Saylin in a recent column in a reference to Saylin's letter to the Enterprise. --["RobRoy"]------
''2005-01-12 08:49:25'' [[nbsp]] Hey, Bev - thanks for the updates.  I was curious about the GSA.  Is that a statewide organization?  --["JabberWokky"]
