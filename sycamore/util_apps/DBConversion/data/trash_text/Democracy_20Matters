       Democracy Matters is a small but active campus organization devoted to strengthening our democratic system. We believe that there is a problem with money in politics that threatens the lifeblood of our country. Our politicians are too dependent on special interests for money to run their campaigns. This makes them beholden to their funders when they are elected. Special interests (corporations and wealthy individuals) have an unfair advantage in our democracy. 

       We are working to bring full public financing of elections to California by 2008. This system is already proven to be effective in Arizona and Maine. If you would like to learn more about this issue or become involved please do so. 

Here are some great websites to explore the issue of clean money:

 * [http://www.caclean.org] -- The CA clean money movement.  Sign the petition.
 * [http://www.publicampaign.org] -- The national clean elections/clean money campaign.
 * [http://www.fundrace.org] -- Look up a map of your neighborhood and see who donated, how much and for whom.
 * [http://www.opensecrets.org] -- Very organized and thorough! Shows which companies and interests have donated and to whom.
 * [http://www.followthemoney.org] -- Data on money in state elections.
 * [http://www.whitehouseforsale.org] -- Data on Pres. race.
 * [http://www.fec.gov] -- Government site that contains all the raw reporting data, opensecrets does a good job of organizing it.
 * [http://www.arnoldwatch.org] -- Keeps track of the special interest money and its influence on the governor.
 * [http://www.geocities.com/cleanelections101] -- One of the Democracy Matters members in Bloomsburg University made this.  It's an easy read...
