Davis is littered with parks and gardens.  Community gardens are areas of land that the Town or the University divide up and rent to locals who grow food for their own use or to be sold at the ["Farmers Market"].  There is an official city of Davis [http://www.city.davis.ca.us/pcs/facility/details.cfm?type=Park parks page].
