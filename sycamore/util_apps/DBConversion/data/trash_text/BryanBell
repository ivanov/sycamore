Hi. I'm a math major here at davis. A new quarter has begun. And I did do allright on the math 108 final. So playing around on the wiki didn't hurt my grades afterall. Maybe the relaxation actually helped me do well on the final :)
[[BR]]Well I finished the finals and kicked ass. So I'm a happy fellow :)
Here are some links to other websites I write on. [http://bjwbell.joeuser.com],[http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~bjwbell/],[http://worldracer.sourceforge.net]
