PBUHKGHGH is the spawn of two projects that never went anywhere.  When Piso Mojado disbanded following the resignation ["GonzaloEyzaguirre"], ex-Piso members ["MikeyBurke"] and ["BrettHart"] formed Droned in winter of '03.  I think Gonzalo left the band because Mikey was not good enough at drums and was too wasted to play most of the time. Droned was equally a lazy project, and as the name suggests, heavy alcohol and drug abuse became a regular affair at practices.  Unfortunately, none of that has really changed...but we have a new name.  And our songs sound okay when we play.  Oh yeah, we have a bass player now named Sean.  And it sounds kinda cool if you know how to say PBUHKGHGH.  Rob Roy always fucks it up.  He always says some cheezy shit like "Kablammo" or "Kablooey".  I thought everyone made that sound... y'know, like when Arnold jumps out of a building right as it.... PBUHKGHGH!!!!!!!!!  It is also the sound that you will hear eminating from your pants when you see us play.
