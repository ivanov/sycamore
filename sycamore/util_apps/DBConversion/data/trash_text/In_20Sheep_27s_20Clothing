In Sheep's Clothing is a yarn store.  They sit above ["Soga's"] and have a whole range of high-quality yarn.  They have a bunch of knitting/sewing acessories (such as books, patterns, and tools).  They also offer classes so you can hone your knitting skills and become one with the yarn.

''I've got 2 scarfs made from yarn purchased here, and I like the way they both feel.'' - ["PhilipNeustrom"]

''I love to knit and shop here fairly often, but the staff seems to have a habit of following around young shoppers at an uncomfortably close distance.'' ["AmeliaCarlson" aec]
