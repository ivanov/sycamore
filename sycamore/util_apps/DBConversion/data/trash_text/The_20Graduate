The Grad is two-faced:  sportsbar by day - "dance club" by night. The official website is http://www.davisgrad.com/

The Davis Graduate offers salsa lessons & dancing every Thursday night for salseros 18 and over. It has a large dance floor, pro lighting, huge sound, two bars, drink specials, pool/games, full service restaurant, plenty of free parking and 80+ beers on tap for $5 cover for the 21+ and $7 for 18+ (there is a discount for college students with/ID). Salsa lessons with Eduardo Currea and associates begin @ 9:30pm and DJ Nehad plays great salsa & merengue.

I personally try to avoid this location.  Last time I went there they were giving away free chewing tobacco at the door. - ["AllanRae"]
