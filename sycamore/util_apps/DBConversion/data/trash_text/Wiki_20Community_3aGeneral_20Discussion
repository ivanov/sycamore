''2005-01-22 21:52:12'' [[nbsp]] Anyone want to make the DPS article the featured page?  Note that I am a discordian. --["BrentLaabs"]------
''2005-01-24 02:17:24'' [[nbsp]] In light of the recent controversy regarding objectivity on pages like ["Davis Players Society"] and ["GASC"](where it was resolved, I think), and in light of people like ["AbbyLawson"] being frustrated to the point of giving up on Davis Wiki, I would like to address everyone and ask you all to show some graciousness toward one another.  These things come in waves, and I know that in the past we have seen a tremendous amount of courtesy and good will from all sides, even on contentious issues.  I look forward to seeing more of that in the future.  As a community, we have accomplished a great deal.  The sheer number of insightful articles--over 1700!--is impressive on its own.  I know that in a positive atmosphere we can accomplish so much more.  Thanks for reading this very long comment. --["MikeIvanov"]------
''2005-01-28 08:06:34'' [[nbsp]] Although it may seem like this is a small community here on the Wiki, I have been talking to people at random about the Wiki.  At this point, virtually anybody I talk to knows it - students, shopowners, random people in front of Chipolte.  If you're feeling at all frustrated, remember that everyone here has created something that the entire town reads, references and uses.  We're creating something of real value. --["JabberWokky"]------
''2005-01-28 14:18:13'' [[nbsp]] That's incredible.  Truly incredible.  I'm not in Davis right now, so I can't witness any buzz about the wiki firsthand, but I know from logs that we certainly get a lot of traffic.  With the new version we're going to release any day now, we should step up our visibility.  I know we're already a terrific resource that everyone loves, but if we got more of the visitors to become contributors, it would take the content to a whole new level. --["MikeIvanov"]------
''2005-01-28 15:01:58'' [[nbsp]] I still feel like no one knows about the wiki. But I'm telling 10-15 people a day, every day about it. Give it a couple more weeks and the buzz will surely take off. A whole new level indeed. I can't wait. --["JackHaskel"]------
''2005-01-28 15:09:12'' [[nbsp]] I keep telling basically everyone I see that has any relation to Davis about it.  So far they mostly just look at the site once and that's about it.  I'm really trying to convience more people to be willing to contribute content as well. --["JevanGray"]------
''2005-01-28 15:37:48'' [[nbsp]] I saw something in ucd.general newsgroup which pointed to here (DavisWiki) concerning wifi hotspots. I looked at this site some more and saw that it is neat. I visited Davis back in May/June 2004 for a couple of days and really liked the town. I am wanting to come back this Spring - late Mar to June timeframe. I took quite a few pics which were contributed to this site. I am thinking of setting up a similar wiki site for Colorado Springs where I live at. I need to get a linux or openBSD box built and find a place to co-locate.  --["BradCuppy"]

''2005-01-30 22:25:06'' [[nbsp]] I notice ["Classified Ads"] and ["Roommate(s) Needed"] have both just been reverted. Anybody want to comment on whether my banishment of these ads should stick? --["KenBloom"]------
''2005-01-31 00:45:10'' [[nbsp]] I don't feel particularly strongly either way about classifieds but I am worried that they would skew search results with the current system. If I'm looking for car repair shops, I don't want to sift though a bunch of car sales listings. If a separate category for them, a la Events, were added, then I don't really see a problem. --["AndrewChen"]------
''2005-01-31 08:05:08'' [[nbsp]] At this point I don't think we should have Classifieds either. Instead we should support the real classifieds out there by linking to them. Davisswap is good. We should encourage them. --["JackHaskel"]------
''2005-01-31 08:05:53'' [[nbsp]] The Swords and Sandals covert ops was fantastic! Way to go guys!  --["JackHaskel"]------
''2005-02-01 11:08:39'' [[nbsp]] Just a thought, but perhaps the hot sauce page might be more appropriate under "Food & Drink" rather than "Davis Life." Wouldn't want to piss off anybody, so I'll leave it to the next guy to decide. --["AlphaDog"]
