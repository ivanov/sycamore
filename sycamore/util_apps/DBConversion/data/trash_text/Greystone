Greystone Apartments are relatively new.  They offer larger kitchens than most apartments, and have nice layouts.  They can be pricey for some students, but are really affordable if you're sharing a room.  

They offer T1 service to the rooms, but they don't let you connect a router to the T1.  It is $20/month for service, and that is linked to the MAC adress, so it is like $20 per person connecting to their network.  Many people opt to go for ["SBC"] DSL or ["Comcast"] cable internet.  Contrary to what Greystone tells you, ["SBC"] DSL is available there.

Note that it is possible to register the MAC address of a router which does network address translation, giving more than one computer internet access.  Such things are literally impossible to detect using software network tools if configured properly, so the only way for them to tell that you are connecting multiple computers through the same MAC address is to physically spot the router.  Get one of your computer nerd friends to set it up for you (finding the MAC address of a router may be tricky as well.)

Another con about the complex is limited parking.  Most of the parking is made up of "covered spots" that cost about $20/month so parking for free is very limited and often unavailable.  To make matters worse, the location has no option for street parking, so if you're going to have a car and don't want to spend on parking, don't live here.  Effective 2004, the management has stated that they will tow cars, even from the uncovered spots, if they don't have a guest permit.  Residents can get a guest permits from the main office.  Duration of the guest permits depends on the situation and office person you talk to.  Other options for parking include parking on Mesquite Dr (off East 8th St) and walking down the bike path that connects to 5th St.  Rumor has it that you can park in the Police Dept's parking lot as long as the car is gone by morning.  This adds a few footsteps, but allows you not to worry about your car being towed by Jed's Towing (Greystone's towing company of choice).

Greystone is on the ["Unitrans"] A line which goes to the ["Shields Library"].  It is about 2 miles from campus, and biking isn't bad since you can use the ["Bike Paths" bike path] and 4th or 3rd street.  5th street isn't recommended for biking, since it's busy and there isn't really much of a bike lane or path.

As a current resident I'd say that its a good complex, but if you live on the 2nd story hope you dont have annoying people beneath you that'll complain to the office because you are vacuuming too loudly for their comfort. 


They offer a free breakfast on Saturday mornings which is a good idea if you're trying to ["Living Cheaply" save money] or ["Alternatives to Buying" not buy anything at all].  It starts at 9:30 am and ends at 11:30, but remember that all of the good food is there for the people who get there early.
