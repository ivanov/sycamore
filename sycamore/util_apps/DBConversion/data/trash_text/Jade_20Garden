Jade Garden is by far the best Chinese restaurant in Davis. The flavors are destinctive and rich while the menu remains large and creative. It's not the typical cornstarch ladden, MSG rich, Davis ["Chinese Food" chinese food]. 

They share a common owner and common menu with the also-great, ["Great Wall"] restaurant in downtown Davis.
