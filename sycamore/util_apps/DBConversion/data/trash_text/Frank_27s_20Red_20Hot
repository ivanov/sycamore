The thick Buffalo Sauce is available for free with any order at ["Jack in the Box"].  Here's the Jack variety:

''it's true, ["AmyZimmerman" Amy] does live off the stuff. We have like 4 bottles in our kitchen. She puts it on everything from steak and fish to candy and fruit. I'm almost positive she brushes her teeth with the stuff.'' - ["SharonZimmerman" Sharon Zimmerman]
