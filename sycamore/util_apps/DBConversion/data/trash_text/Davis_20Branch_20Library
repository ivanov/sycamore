A branch of the county library system, there is a good-sized children's room, fiction section, non-fiction section, and a good number of career and test preparation books. Study carrels and tables are available, as well as computers for the general public. Weekdays before 2 p.m. is the best time to go to check out a book or just browse. After 1:30-2:00 p.m. weekdays, students from the local schools come in and usually fill the available tables/study space. 

Parking is usually not a problem, but because it is a city lot, the lot can fill up at certain times and days of the week. This is true for weekdays around 2:30-3:00 p.m., when tons of parents commandeer the lot, waiting to pick up their little darlings from North Davis. The same parents will overrun the lot on Saturday mornings, when they come to watch the same little darlings participate in soccer. This has occasionally led to frustrated library patrons complaining to library staff, who can't do anything about it because it's a city lot.

A few times a year, the Friends of the Davis Library will hold book sales. These are good for picking up some fiction or non-fiction on the cheap, and are usually in the Dick Blanchard Room (named after a long-time friend of the library who worked at Shields Library). Once or twice a year they'll hold their annual sale, which is held at the high school. Be aware that members of the Friends get first dibs on the night before the sale is thrown open to the public. The Friends also maintain a book/magazine nook just inside the library entrance-- a good opportunity to pick up older magazines or cheap beach books for  mere change.
