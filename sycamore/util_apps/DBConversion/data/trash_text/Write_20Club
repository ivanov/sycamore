["RobRoy"] started Write Club early in the year 2003. It lasted for a year before the university shut it down after a poetry reading that offended some people. The irony was that the poetry reading was not a Write Club event but rather an Art opening that happened to have a few Write Club members. The Cops shut it down all because someone said the word "fuck". To quote the curator of the ["MU"] Art Gallery (which is on the second floor) "Language has no place in poetry." Who knows what that means but it certainly shows that the art department on campus is pretty fucked up.

The purpose of Write Club was to provide a forum for people who were interested in performing self written literary works. The organization boasted almost a hundred members.

the website [http://www.writeclub.net  Writeclub.net] has not been updated for a long while. One day ["RobRoy"] may do something with it again.
