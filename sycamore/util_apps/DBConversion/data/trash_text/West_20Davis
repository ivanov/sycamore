West Davis is the hip slang name for most any place in Davis west of ["Highway 113"]. West Davis is populated primarily by masses of residental housing projects. It lacks many of the life-giving strip mall amenities found in the other sections of Davis, and is annoyingly far to bike to ["Campus"] from.

Those who go ''too'' far West in West Davis run a dangerous risk of coming upon ["Winters"]
