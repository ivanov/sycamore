The Yolo County Probation Work Program is quite simply what you do to stay out of ["Yolo County Jail" jail] when you have pled no contest to criminal charges. It is also your only alternative to jail if you've been sentenced to less than 90 days (the minimum for ["House Arrest" house arrest] in Yolo County).

It costs $214 to be part of the program. In addition to hundreds of dollars of legal fees.

Common things that Work Program employees do is clean the ["Yolo County Animal Shelter"], clean up the highways, clean the ["Parks"] in ["Davis"], ["Winters"], ["Woodland"] and other smaller communities, sweat a lot, mow fields at the various ["Yolo County Housing Projects"], mow and clean the exterior of ["Yolo County Libraries"], miscellaneous office work for the program, get a sore back, mumble, grumble, gripe, mow and clean up various other properties belonging to ["Yolo County"], and then finally: count how many days are left in their probation work sentence.
