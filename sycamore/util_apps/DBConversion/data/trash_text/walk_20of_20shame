The walk across ["Campus" campus] in the same clothes as yesterday after you slept with someone and spent the night in their ["Dorms" dorm room].

The best walks of shame occur when there was an exchange or themed party the night before, and the clothes are extremely obvious.  Also after a cocktail or formal, and you have to tote your formal shoes.

''Scott: hey man, nice hair - you doin the walk of shame?
Dan: what, me? ah... no... I, um, fell asleep in the library...''
