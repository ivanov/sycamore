Dutton Hall is located across from the east wing of the Quad and sits slightly behind ["North Hall"] and South Hall.

Dutton Hall houses the Student ["Financial Aid Office"], Student Aid Accounting, Cashier's Office, Undergraduate Scholarship office, Learning Skills Center, Upward Bound, Early Academic Outreach Program, ["Student Judicial Affairs"], and the Student Employment Center.

Basically, you usually only end up there to resolve Financial Aid matters.  A huge line of people can be seen, waiting to enter Dutton Hall, at the beginning of each quarter.  This is because those who do not Direct Deposit their Financial Aid checks must pick them up here.  Lesson learned:  '''Direct Deposit your checks.'''

Outside of Dutton, right in front, sits ["The Saddest Fountain"].

Also known, through (sometimes intentional) mispronounciation, as "Durden Hall," in reference to the protagonist in [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/ Fight Club].
