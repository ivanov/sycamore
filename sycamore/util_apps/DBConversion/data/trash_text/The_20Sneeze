According to ["RobRoy"], the Sneeze was created by ["James Mah"] after ["The California Aggie"] did not hire him as a columnist. The Sneeze was a humor publication and is no longer in print. Most of the articles made fun of the ["The California Aggie" Aggie].  At first it entertained general campus themed ''shock humour'', ie writing things so crude and juvenile that it was funny (to some people at least, I think).  Eventually however, penis and orgy jokes began to get old, and The Sneeze lost all semblance of being about anything other than James Mah's bitterness at not being hired by the Aggie.
