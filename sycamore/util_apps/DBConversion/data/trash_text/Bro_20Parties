Bro parties are parties (not always ["Frat Parties"]) where the atmosphere is shady, ghetto music is pumping, and most people are there for the ["free beer"] and drunk chicks.  You just go for the free booze, really -- and that's perfectly okay.  These just aren't really places you can meet quality people.  They're good for getting ["drunk"] off ["Natural Ice" Natty Ice] and freaking with some skanky girl.
