Cellular coverage within Davis varies considerably, especially indoors. If you're looking for a new phone or service, try and find someone who already has it or take advantage of the 14-30 day trial period to make sure it will work where you want.  If you're curious where the towers are located, you can see them on the [http://www.ci.davis.ca.us/cmo/is/telecomm/ City of Davis's Telecomm Site guide].

When shopping for a new phone and/or service, the magic number is $39.99. If you get a plan at this monthly rate or higher, the dealer gets a much larger commission than for lower plans. Thus, they will offer lower prices and/or larger rebates. 

Note that there may be an activation fee for new accounts. Also, the monthly rate does not include fees and taxes, which may be anywhere from $3/month to over $10/month.

''2005-01-03 20:41:07'' [[nbsp]] My phone switches between cingular and AT&T.  Even though the two carriers share towers, i tend to get different reception depending on which carrier my phone selects.  However, I tend to get coverage everywhere in Davis.  The weakest coverage is around campus, but is not terrible. --["JaimeRaba"]------
''2005-01-03 21:02:22'' [[nbsp]] In north-east Davis (north of Covell), indoor reception is pretty poor with T-Mobile and Cingular. I can get a strong signal outside but it drops to 0 once I step a few feet away from any windows. Maybe my walls are lined with lead or something. --["AndrewChen"]------
''2005-01-04 00:43:02'' [[nbsp]] I used to have horrible coverage (AT&T) in north davis, but since they combined with cingular, I get good to great coverage all over davis --["PaulLanzi"]------
''2005-01-05 14:29:16'' [[nbsp]] I use cingular, and don't get reception in some places in ["Kemper Hall"], and inside other large buildings like the ["Memorial Union" MU] --["KenBloom"]
