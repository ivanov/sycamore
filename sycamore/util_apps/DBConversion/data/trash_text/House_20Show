House shows are the best place to find new music. Most bands start off there careers by playing house shows.

A house show is a concert that is held at a house. It is usually illegal because a noise permit is practically impossible to get in Davis but it is always fun. So when going to a house show it is always best to bring a few bucks to give to the bands who may be on tour and a few more bucks in case the hosts of the show get a ["noise violation"]. But house shows are always cheaper than seeing a band at a bar.

Davis has a long history of putting  house shows. The Sacramento band Cake used to play in Davis all the time when they were starting. DJ Shadow used to spin records at House dance shows. At the ["Dam Haus"] Babes in Toyland, Outhud, ["Sexy Prison"], and Casiotone for the Painfully Alone, as well as many other bands have played in the living room. At the ["Pirate Ship"] such touring acts as the Replacements, Violent Femmes, Meat Puppets, Camper Van Beethoven, and Jason Webley have played there over it 25 year history. Recently local bands like ["GnarToon"], ["ChoadBot"], and the ["Playboy Millionaires"] have played there.

So that means it is a good idea to check out a house show because they are always entertaining.  And if you want to be able to say "I knew them when" when a band gets famous then check 'em out at a house show.

Oh, and always try to ["BYOB"].
