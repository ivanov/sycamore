I'm Adam, and I'm a Computer Engineering Graduate Student.  You'll most likely find me hanging around ["Kemper Hall" EUII] or in ["Academic Surge"].  I am working on research in computer graphics and computer networking.  You'll also find me ["Teaching Assistants" TAing] EEC172 (Microcomputer-Based System Design).
