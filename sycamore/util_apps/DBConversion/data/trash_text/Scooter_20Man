"Scooter Man" is none other than Daniel Quincy, an all levels Tai-chi instructor at the ["Experimental College"].

He is an older fellow, so he wears a helmet and a reflective vest when he rides his razor scooter. As for the bags hanging off his scooter, he likes to keep up with current events and holistic health news. Scooter man always has a huge smile on his face. He must be a happy man.

His classes are taught either in the Surge courtyard or at Central Park early in the morning.
