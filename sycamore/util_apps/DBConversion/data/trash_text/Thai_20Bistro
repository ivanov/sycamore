Thai Bistro is one of the better restaurants in all of ["Davis"]. If you haven't been yet you really are missing something great. 
Many of the dishes are quite unusual and the portions are large. Most of items are not found at any of the other Thai places in town. Not only is the food great but the service is speedy and super friendly and the location with an outside patio on E Street Plaza is awesome. Be sure to try the black sticky rice dessert. They have good deals on lunch specials. The lunch food is not served at dinner.

The ["The California Aggie" Aggie] voted Thai Bistro as "Best Thai food in Davis" in 2004. Read their review: [http://www.californiaaggie.com/article/?id=3983]

''2004-12-14 23:20:26'' [[nbsp]] In my opinion this place and 2KThai are about neck to neck for best Thai in town.. lately I've preferred Thai Bistro - By contrast in my humble opinion as a self-declared connossier of Thai food, Sophia's is so terrible I am actually offended when people say good things about it. - ["KrisFricke"]------
''2004-12-16 18:33:34'' [[nbsp]] My experience is that there are two kind of Thai restaurants in the States, those that use sugar and those that don't. Although I really liked the soup at Thai Bistro, I found the main dishes I tried too sweet. I think they are in the sugared-dish camp. - ["TomHinds"]------

''2005-01-23 00:42:39'' [[nbsp]] Anyone who's lived in Davis knows this is the former site of the late, great Crepe Bistro. I have many fond memories of fondue and crepes. :( The Crepe Bistro succumbed in part due to the fire that temporarily closed down several stores in this block.  --["CentralDavisite"]
