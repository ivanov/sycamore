The Eggheads are one of several public ["Campus Art"] pieces. Commissioned from Robert Arneson in 1989, ''The Egghead Series'' is one of the most memorable parts of the Davis campus.  7 of these white, smooth eggheads are scattered about the campus. 

They are:
  * ["Bookhead"]
  * ["Eye On Mrak (Fatal Laff)"]
  * ["See No Evil Hear No Evil"] (pictured above)
  * ["Stargazer"]
  * ["Yin And Yang"]

Robert Arneson taught at Davis from 1962 until 1991, when he retired.  He completed the series shortly before his death in 1992.

From Webster's Dictionary:
 Egghead:: Intellectual, highbrow.
