Where sasha came from or where she is going is a complete mystery. Her early years were spent under some mysterious but harsh conditions. It's obvious she was mistreated by her first owners as she has a slight aversion to people touching her feet, and cries everytime you bump her with something. After that she spent some time in Doggie Jail where she learned to be a junkey ho like her idol Jerry Blank. She was the rescued by Faith and Wade and taken to thier Rescued Animal Compound in West Sac. Faith and Wade's place was a sideshow all to it's self. Faith is an attractive ex-exotic dancer. When Faith had to leave for vet school, JonDsouza was asked to be her new daddy, he accepted. She now lives at the Nova House, and loves to get high at parties. when her daddy gets ripped she gives him a look that says, "Oh god hes fucked up again" and the walks away.  

Sasha has gained notoriety for her wholly unnatural (for a dog) way of sitting and her propensity for wearing clothing.  She belongs to ["JonDsouza"].
