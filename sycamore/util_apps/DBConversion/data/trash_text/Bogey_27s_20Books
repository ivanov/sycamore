Bogey's Books is a wonderful little independent bookstore located in the heart of ["Downtown"].  Why would you go to ["Borders"] if you can find your book here?  ["Borders"] doesn't even smell like books!  By and large their books are cheaper than those found at ["Borders"], largely because most of the books they carry are used. Being a used bookstore, they also buy books. They also carry some new(er) books, including fairly recent releases that have been discounted/marked down a bit from what you might find in a "new books" bookstore. As an independent "used books" bookstore, Bogey's complements ["The Avid Reader"], which carries "new books." On the display tables by the fiction shelves you'll often find lesser-known or underrated fiction works that are often quite good. 

The owner of Bogey's books, Mark Nemmers, has been [http://www.gallerybooks.com/bkm/bkm70703.htm quite active in fighting the establishment] of ["Borders"].
