This place is a bit hidden but the food is ok.  

Delicious nachos.

 * yeah, the nachos cost about 8 bucks but they can feed three people. The are gigantic. They must weigh around six pounds. - ["RobRoy"]

''A huge waste of money and time. Limited menu; high prices. Go to ["Gardenia's"] instead.'' -["TonyMagagna"]

''Well, there's no truly authentic mexican food to be found anywhere in Davis, although there's definitely moments of it at Guad, Taqueria Davis and El Mariachi.  However, I think the menu is far better at La Esperanza than Gardenia's.  Gardenia presents an illusion of choice on their menu, but really they just switch up the sauce and whether it's in a tortilla or not.  La Esperanza is a bit more traditional gringo fare, but at least it's dependable and made with a larger variety of ingredients.  Even though there's limited variety of salsas, they are more flavorful and interesting at La Esperanza.  (Also the best in town is probably at El Mariachi or Dos Coyotes.)  La E also has decent lunch specials, as well as a 2-for-1 coupon in the ["Entertainment Book"].'' -["JaimeRaba" jr]

Origionally they were also located downtown at the northeast corner of G and 2nd in a building that was torn down and replaced:
