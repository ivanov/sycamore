= Laundromats/Self Laundry Services =

Are you tired of waiting for a machine to wash your clothes in your apartment's cramped laundry facilities...the one with 3-4 machines for 200 tenants?  You might want to cart it all to a nearby laundry facility.

Here is a [http://local.google.com/local?hl=en&lr=&sa=G&near=davis,+CA&q=category:+Laundries+Self+Service local.google search] of "Davis and nearby laundromats"  . After we get a list going, someone can delete this link.

In the meantime, let me tell you about one that I visited.

==Soap City==
Westlake Shopping Center
Davis, CA 95616 
(530) 758-3709 

'''''Description'''''
''If you want to wash your clothes and don't care that the place is nasty and grimy, ant-ridden, and has washing and drying machines (with the exception of 3 or 4) from the early 80s (with green rings in the sight windows of some--you know, like what accumulates in the nose holder of old eye glasses), go here!''

==Suds Laundromat==
1801 Hanover Dr
Davis, CA 95616
(530) 757-7837

'''''Description'''''
''The facilities are decent.  Just be prepared to spend at least $.0.25/7 min. X 45 minutes to get your clothes dry.  Also, if you want to retain your appetite for the day, have the staff clean the filters.''
