Mark Champagne is the "business manager" of ["ASUCD"].  What this means is that he is the highest ranking university employee in ASUCD, and he secretly holds all the strings in ASUCD.

In ASUCD you see, you have students, who are usually volunteers or at best "at-will" employees who may be fired or shot at whim; and you have career employees who are subject to university union contracts, are not students, and your elected officials couldn't fire them if they ate their babies.  Mark is the boss of the latter.  Any baby eating complaints should be directed to him.

As the éminence grise of ASUCD, he operates in such secrecy that you won't find any mention of him on the [http://asucd.ucdavis.edu/ official ASUCD webpage].  He tells the business units what to do.  He discusses floss with ["Vicki Swett"] in the ["MU"], apparently.  The ASUCD budget is drafted by ["Vicki Swett"], goes to the ASUCD President's office, then goes to Mark, then goes to Senate for final approval, with minor changes at every step of the way.

Fortunately, however, in the opinion of this writer at least, Mark's alignment appears to be basically good.  He just has the misfortune of being placed in the centre of a great behemoth of incompetent governance, much like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruschev Kruschev].
