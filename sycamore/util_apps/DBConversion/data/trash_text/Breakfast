Sometimes you just want to get some breakfast.  And sometimes you want breakfast not at breakfast-time.  This is your guide.  How late a business is open at night is the focus of the entry for ["Night Time" night time].

= Breakfast Served All Day = 

 * ["Abe's"] - Lots of "buy one, get one free" coupons in the mail and on ["Super Saver Card" Davis Super Saver Cards]!
 * ["Baker's Square"] - You can substitute hashbrowns/potatoes for rice or mashed potatoes!
 * ["Cindy's"] - Fresh squeezed orange juice.  You can watch them squeeze it.  More entertaining than hot-dog-on-a-stick, but weaker costumes.

 * ["Crepe Cart in the Silo"] - ''They'' have true breakfast crepes.
