''Describe ["ChrisTakemura"] here.''

No.

''Please?''

No.

''Fine.  Describe something else, then.  Possibly in an IF sort of way.''

You see here a desk.  It is strewn with papers in varying stages of illegibility.  Some of them are autographed by personalities whose names you would probably recognize if you could be arsed.  Most of them are not.  The sound of several fans comes from the underpopulated EIA rack to your right.

There is a ruler here.[[BR]]
There is a cup of coke (half-full.)[[BR]]
There is a magic 8-ball here.

''Use magic 8-ball''

(Picking up the 8-ball.)[[BR]]
You shake the 8-ball vigorously, muttering your question in its general direction.  Turning it over, you read the words "ACT NOW."

(Your score just went up 5 points.)

''Drink coke''

Bad move.  That stuff's been there for at least two weeks.[[BR]]
The room swirls around you.  You feel woozy.  You sit down.[[BR]]

''Examine rack''

You'll have to get up first.[[BR]]

''Stand''

Difficult, but you manage it.  Eight turns in, and you still haven't got out of the opening room.  Good work, Action Jackson.[[BR]]
[[BR]]
You notice exits to the east and north.

''East''

You bump straight into ["ChrisTakemura"], a man so consumed by the past that he still calls ["Kemper Hall"] EUII. What sauce!

''Look at Chris''

Waitaminute. . .  You're trying to trick me into ''describing'' him, aren't you?  It won't work.
