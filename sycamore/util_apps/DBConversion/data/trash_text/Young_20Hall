It be where the ["Psychology" psych] and ["Anthropology" anthro] people are, right by the ["Death Star"].  Rumor is, they are the reason for the existence of the Death Star.  They wanted to perform experiments on students in mazes so they disguized it as a building.  Unlucky students that wander in and lose their way (if not sanity) are observed by the psych department researchers.  Those that make it out sometimes find middle eastern or asian food.  The unlucky ones are eaten.  The remains of past students are studied by the anthropologists.

Leaving Young, you might run into ["Stargazer"].
