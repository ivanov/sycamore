[http://ucdavis.thefacebook.com/profile.php?id=3201807 Kris Fricke] is the Chief Justice of the ["ASUCD Court"].  In this position he has sworn in two ["ASUCD"] Presidents so far, presided over about six cases, and been considered for impeachment twice.

He may or may not be associated with the infamous [http://www.livejournal.com/users/emosnail/ EMOSNAIL livejournal] (Echidna Media Organization S.N.A.I.L. Project), and fancies himself a decent [http://snailtyrant.deviantart.com photographer].  In addition to the previous link, he also has accrued a [http://photobucket.com/albums/v16/snail_tyrant/ large stash of photographs] on photobucket that includes a lot of pictures of his [http://photobucket.com/albums/v16/snail_tyrant/Comrades/ friends], not all of which were taken by himself.

If you still hunger for relevant links, Justice Fricke has caused the creation of this [http://www.geocities.com/winged_snail/cntnt.htm link page] as part of his shockingly shoddy website.

Kris has shocked everyone by having a [http://photobucket.com/albums/v16/snail_tyrant/Photo%20Essays/Kristy%20Visits%20II/?action=view&current=asapoc071.jpg remarkably beautiful] girlfriend, ["Kristy Heidenberger"].

'''Did You Know:''' ["Oxford Circle Park"] (AKA "Little Big People Park")is was Kris' first and most physical lasting mark on Davis.  As one of three people on the City Renovations sub-Committee he was influential in deciding on the final equipment composition, and specifically the final red/blue colour scheme was wholly his idea (versus blue/yellow ("school colours") and green/silver ("to blend in with the trees")- yuck!).  Kris still considers the park with its unique geodesic equipment to be his li'l baby.


'''The Below is Not necessarily Endorsed by Kris Fricke:'''[[BR]]
It is well established hearsay that Kris is an Elimiaphile, owns a grappling hook, studied propaganda so much that he will be a guest lecturer for a propaganda class in Spring, does court drawings, and that he was once offered a bribe for an official position.

''2004-12-21 14:35:35'' [[nbsp]] I can't believe the Chancellor repiled to your email.  Did you give him a link to here? - ["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2004-12-22 18:13:24'' [[nbsp]] Hey Kris, the court cases can't be found online somewhere?  I'm not sure that posting them all on the wiki is a good idea?  I mean, what's the copyright on them? - ["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2004-12-22 18:16:02'' [[nbsp]] Erg, it looks like you guys basically never have cases.  I guess it's cool then -- I was just concerned about 200 court cases or something :)  Just make sure they aren't copyrighted ? - ["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2004-12-22 18:20:29'' [[nbsp]] The cases are surely public information.  No government documents have copyrights. - ["KrisFricke"]------
''2004-12-22 18:21:10'' [[nbsp]] and its really been bothering me that they aren't available somewhere so if its alright with you I am overjoyed to have them hosted here. - ["KrisFricke"]------
''2004-12-22 18:30:03'' [[nbsp]] Yeah, sounds great.  They are very relevant to Davis, aren't found anywhere else, and are public information.  You might want to put a note on the main court page about where (if you were so inclined) you could find official copies of the cases (as these can't be official because they are edited, etc).  Even though they might not even be avail. at SGAO, might as well say it's worth a try. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2004-12-22 18:47:27'' [[nbsp]] Further elaboration on copyrights - things on the official ASUCD webpage might be copyrighted - at least Alex Park (the IT guy) might THINK they're copyrighted and get butthurt, but for example Senate Resolutions / Bills, minutes, budgets, (Court findings) and other official government business are certainly not copyrighten - ["KrisFricke"]

''2005-01-28 22:08:45'' [[nbsp]] kris, the agasa redirect is useless because nothing links to it. as of know, links are case sensitive. there is also an AGASA redirect which things '''do''' link to, but nothing currently links to the agasa redirect, making it useless. --["ArlenAbraham"]
