Transfer student trying to flee from psychology into the safe, welcoming arms of the English department. For some reason, I am actually looking forward to taking my English Comp requirement next quarter (Winter 2005 incase I get lazy). Am also  Condemned to die alone with lots of cats. Currently employed by the Health Sciences Library across LaRue. I would like to thank Philip for fixing my page on my new "let's waste time!" amusement because I cannot code CSS to save my life. 

Minoring in medieval studies and WOW now I actually look like a girl in this one. 

Other points of amusement (because you know... bah! who needs that English degree with a random minor anyways?!)

[http://www.livejournal.com/users/psychababble] Yup. Hawt dawg diggity. Because yes, classes come second. (I've managed to convince myself it's going to help my writing ONE of these days.

She is now also the secondary master of 'Twiggie' aka ["ChrisRood"]
