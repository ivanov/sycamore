The Tennis Club Apartments is an apartment complex located in ["South Davis"] at 4141 Cowell Blvd. The complex is known for being home to mostly to middle class families, young professionals, and only a few UC Davis students and staff.

The complex gained the town's spotlight on November 18, 2004 when one of its residents, Dennis Thrower, was shot to death in an exchange of gunfire with one or two individuals at around 5:50 am. The incident was Davis' first homicide since 1998, leaving many residents of the complex and South Davis baffled as to how the murder could have happened in a relatively uneventful and quiet part of town, where crime rarely rises above bicycle thefts and several car burglaries.  There's a small ["The California Aggie" Aggie] [http://californiaaggie.com/article/?id=6456 story] on the murder.
