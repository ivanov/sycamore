UC Davis' freshman and transfer student summer orientation program, put on by Advising Services. 

The program changes slightly from year to year, but essentially it is a chance to:
 * get a feel for the campus
 * take your placement tests
 * meet some people and make some friends
 * learn about academic and non-academic programs
 * register for classes

If you're a freshman, it's a 3 day (2 nights) program: at all costs, don't let your parents come, because they'll only prevent you from having a good time. 

If you want to spend less money and you live in the area, you can also opt to only participate in the day activities, meaning you won't get meals or a place to sleep. At least, that's how it was 5 years ago when I was a freshmen, and it was definitely worth it. - ["TerraSmithers"]
