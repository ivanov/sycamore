The International House of Pancakes is located in South Davis, on Richards.

It closes daily.  In the opinion of some commentators, this makes it unique among IHOPs, and not in a good way.  Apart from that, there's nothing special about it.

The strangest dish I've ever had there was the Belgiam Bacon Waffle (Seasonal).
