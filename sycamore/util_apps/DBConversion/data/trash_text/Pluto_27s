Pluto's serves out-of-this world food in a fun, stylish atmosphere. Just walk right in, grab one of those slips of paper, and hand it to the guys on the other side of the counter to punch.

They serve food in categories:

'''Greens & Things'''
Pluto's salads are incredible. You can choose up to seven additions to either romaine or a mix. Delicious, sauces, bread and an option for meat finish them off. These are delicious, not to mention an excellent value.

'''Veggies & Spuds'''
This category includes all sorts of delicious side dishes. They usually even have Brussels sprouts. The garlic potato rings and onion rings are incredible. Note that the onion rings come with spicy BBQ sauce by default; mild is available on request.

'''Meat & Poultry'''
They have a nice hot gas grill operating right in front of you to cook your meat. The options include Flank Steak, sausages, chicken and roast turkey.

'''Quenchers'''
Water, beer and a good selection of non-standard sodas are available, amongst other things.

'''Sweets'''
Lemon bars, brownies and cookies fill a glass-covered cake case next to the register.  Prices are a little high for the quality of the treats.

'''Little Astronaunts'''(aka the children's menu)

And it is so fun. Really, you walk in, grab a little menu card, and as you make your rounds to each different category, the chef-behind the counter hole-punches your card. It's like a time-card, but for food. Then you check out at the counter and viola! Eat your stellar meal.  If you eat there often, be sure to ask to be put "in the book".  They'll enter your name in the binder and after 10 meals, your 11th is free!

Plutos also has a handful of other restaurants in nearby galaxies, for a full listing check out their webpage [http://www.plutosfreshfood.com]

 *Pluto's first store opened up in the MASSIVE yuppie boom that took over the Marina district of San Francisco in 1996. The food's great but what about the grandmothers? -["JackHaskel"]
