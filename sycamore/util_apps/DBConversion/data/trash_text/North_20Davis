North Davis is Davis lingo for the area north of West ["Covell"] and west of F Street [and mostly East of ["Highway 113"]]. North Davis contains many valuble Davis businesses, many of which are in the popular strip mall ["The Marketplace"], as well as a number of housing complexes with very high student populations.

Visitors to North Davis who find themselves going much too far North may very well end up in the treacherous municipality of ["Woodland"].
