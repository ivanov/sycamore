The Yolo County Animal Shelter is run by the Yolo County Sheriff's Department. They house ["dogs"], ["cats"], ["horses"], ["goats"], and although they want to keep it a secret: ["Mice" mice]. It is easy to adopt an animal from there and for the most part the animals that are store there are treated nicely. 

If you go in the middle of the day you should beware that it may be closed for lunch.

The Animal Shelter is cleaned by the Yolo County Work Probation Program.

Some of the ["Wiki Animals"] have spent time at the Yolo County Animal Shelter.
