Segundo North is the name given to the new dorm area of ["Segundo"] at the corner of ["La Rue"] and ["Anderson Rd."].

The three buildings in the area are: ["Alder Hall"], ["Thompson Hall"], and ["Miller Hall"]. 

 The building represent a new thought in dorm life and the aestetics behind it. Rooms are all double occupancy, with four rooms of eight people sharing a bathroom. The four rooms are known as a "cluster". Floors in each building have approximately 40 residents each, creating a small and close community. The new ["Tercero South"] dorms, opening in Fall 2005, will also be built in this same style.
