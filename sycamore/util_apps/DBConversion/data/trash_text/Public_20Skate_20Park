The public skate park was constructed in 199-something. It used to have a locked gate around it to keep kids from skating when it was "closed" (they previously had some civil servant supervising the place) but kids continuously broke through the fence to skate at night. Now they just leave it open all the time. Good place to go if you're in the mood for ditching classes at ["Davis Senior High School"]. Not that I would know...
