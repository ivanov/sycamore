This seems to be a series of stencils produced by the same group or at least in a very similiar style.  All were found during the summer of 2004 and appeared during spring quarter of that year.  They were found on ["Campus"] and the part of ["Downtown"] closest to ["Campus"].  The others in the series are:

This stencil was found on the side of the ["Death Star"] on 11-15-2004.  It is in the same style as the other political stencils from the summer of 2004.  There were 2 other new stencils (no pictures of those yet), also obviously by the same group/individual:

A lot of the original stencils are now painted over.  The city seems to be using bright ''silver'' paint to cover some of them, which makes for some really ugly sidewalk.

''sidenote:'' Check out some of these [http://www.banksy.co.uk/menu.html tight stencils] by london's own, "Bansky".
