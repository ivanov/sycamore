Owned and managed by Rebecca Sands, Savvy Shoppe isn't an ordinary boutique here in Davis.  The prices aren't bone-crushingly impossible.  The store carries a gag of high class brands in both men's and women's styles.  A specialty seems to be cocktail dresses and formal wear.  Shoe pickins are pretty small and there's a glass case of expensive accessories.  The store is equipped with comfy dressing rooms and the hospitable management will find you the right size and style for you.

If you sign up for their mailing list, you are invited to a special closed preview party whenever they receive new shipments of clothing. They wine and dine you with pate, caviar and champagne as well as give you a 10-20% discount that night.
