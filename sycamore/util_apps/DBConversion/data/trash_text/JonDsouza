Ok so I was being lazy the day beofre while trying to beautify this site. 

I am Jon D'souza, AKA Pestalance sometimes Plague. I have a penchant for Bjork and all things strange. I have been told I dress well, I beg to differ. Im an artist and a writer, though I have been in a bit of a lull lately. I design my own clothes, when I can. I wish I was born in the 70's punk era New York / London. I dream, what I dream becomes reality. Vivan Westwood is awsome. I like boys and girls, I like boys better. I speak my mind. My mind is dirty. ["Sasha" shasha] is my doggie, I call her stinkypants.

Word is that Jon is one of the many people running for ASUCD senate with ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"].
