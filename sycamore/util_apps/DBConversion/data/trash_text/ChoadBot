Here is what ["RobRoy"] has to say about ChoadBot (from Friendster):


''When I talked to people about ChoadBot I say, "Fuck what you heard. Believe
the hype." Because they are a hyped up band and even though it seems like an oxymoron the hype is honest. When I saw them I nearly died. Not because I started screaming so load that in comparison Beatlemania would feel like an afternoon on Cspan but because I nearly suffocated from all the hot sex in the room. And when Berry Choad nearly killed himself when he started breaking every bone in his body he was a Christ like figure. I kept chanting "What would Iggy Pop do." And he did what Iggy Pop would do. He grabbed a few innocent audience members and shoved so much hot sex into their orifices that the floor became wet with puddles of joyful urine.''

Also, a review by the ["Dam Haus"] (Friendster):

''I think the Guiness Book of World Records should contain an entry for "The most cliches incorporated into one band: Choadbot (sunglasses at night, rolling around on broken glass, instrument switcheroos, girl in slinky dress playing keyboards, lotsa stripping and nipple-rubbing, taking forever to set up, trying to make everyone clap to the beat, boys in make-up, and the newest rock cliche and certainly the most ingenious, a lead singer in a bathrobe and Tevas." It was especially funny that after their hour-long seven song set at ["Plainfield Station"], they offered CDRs for sale
with one song on it, and admitted, "It's actually our only song." If you haven't seen ChoadBot, be ready to hear the word "choad" more times in one hour than you've ever heard it in all your life.''
