Woodstock's Pizza has to be the most popular pizza joint in Davis.  Besides decent pizza at a fairly reasonable price, their menu offers salads, chicken wings, and frosted "cinnabread."  

Woodstock's is generally loud and full of life.

They deliver.  They'll even deliver to campus, but they will NOT go into buildings.  You'll have to station someone outside to wait for the delivery guy.

''One time, I walked into Woodstock's around closing time -- which is incidentially bar closing time -- and ordered a pizza.  I left with it and before I could cross the street a brigade of 3 huge, drunk men were pushing me and trying to steal my pizza.  I handed the pizza to my female friend and she ran off with it as I distracted them.'' - ["PhilipNeustrom"]
