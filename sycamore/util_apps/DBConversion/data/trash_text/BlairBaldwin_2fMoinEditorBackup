Being a valued institution of research and learningsment, the University of California, Davis is in a state of constant change and flux. To keep explorers of the University informed of this fact, the kind fellows in its administration often feel it necessary to erect gigantic colorful signs in front of future construction projects.

These signs generally include a brief description of the widget to be built, along with a dollar figure of how much the project is costing the University (at least, how much it cost at the time they put down the sign). Sometimes they even have sassy concept art. 

Though many of the signs advertise a web site ([http://growthplanning.ucdavis.edu]) with news articles related to Campus growth, this site gives no indication of how many construction projects are currently going on, nor even '''how many of these delightful signs have been placed'''. No one has stepped up to fill this void. UNTIL NOW.
