2004-12-10  We've hit the ["Thousandth Wiki Page" thousand page mark] today!  Let the revolution begin!

2004-12-08  We were unfortunately experiencing some problems with our hosting company today.  We apologize and we're working on moving to a better place right now.  If you have any spare computer parts (a big hard drive, an old computer) that we could use, drop a line in ["Wiki hosting"].  Note that there ''may'' have been a period of about 3 hours in which edits were lost (8AM-11AM), so check ["Recent Changes"] if you made edits during this time.   You may need to re-do your changes if they happened then.  We're very sorry but the problem was completely out of our control.

2004-12-05  In a hilariously ironic twist, soon after we made a ["Wiki Flyer" flyer] making light of the demise of davis411.com, our hosting company decided to put us on a new server and bring this site down for about 4 hours every night.  Our apologies if you were unable to access the site.  We are working day and night on moving to more reliable hosting.  You can help by ["Donate" donating] a few bucks to our selfless cause.

2004-11-21  We have made some cosmetic adjustments to the search results and revamped the ["Recent Changes"] interface.  We encourage you to write some comments when you edit a page, now that we have plenty of room for them.  Questions/comments?  Leave a note in ["To Do"].
