''Eye On Mrak (Fatal Laff)'' is one of ["The Eggheads"] on campus.  It sits in front of ["Mrak Hall"].

This is the side facing away from Mrak hall and toward ["Shields Library"].

This is the side facing Mrak hall.  The eye was originally placed to stare directly at the Chancellor's office, but he has since moved.
