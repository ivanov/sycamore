Rent-a-Band for the Holidays was an idea suggested in the 1980s by ["BevSykes"] because every year the ["Davis Senior High School"] high school ["Madrigal Choir"] offered to go to private homes to sing, as a fund-raiser.  Sykes' daughter at that time was playing in the school band and suggested that the band do the same thing.

Small groups of band members are available to perform for events from December 1 through December 20, with the proceeds going to support the ["Davis Senior High School" DHS] band program.

Call 758-7671 for details.
