In the tradition of hiding things in basements, the ["Art Department"] decided to stash an ["Art Galleries" art gallery] in the basement of the ["Art Building"].

''2005-01-27 18:50:40'' [[nbsp]] I think that this should be called "The Basment Gallery" because that's what it's called. the article distingushes it from other basement galleries. it's not just ''a'' basment gallery, it's ''The'' Basement Gallery. --["ArlenAbraham"]------
''2005-01-28 15:08:55'' [[nbsp]] Are there other basement galleries?  I think it's more appropriate to leave articles out of page names, such as in the case of the ["Arboretum"].  And wherever there is ambiguity, it's much better to add discriptive words to the page name rather than an article.  Calling the page The Basement Gallery doesn't really resolve the problem of having multiple basement galleries.  Perhaps Art Department Gallery or something along those lines would be more appropriate if there are truly several basement galleries. --["MikeIvanov"]
