Shoulder tapping refers to the illegal process where a person who is not of age asks somone who is of age to buy them cigarettes or, more commonly, ["Alcohol"]. Those who are shoulder tapped should be careful as the ["DPD"] occasionaly runs sting operations targeting those willing to buy ["Alcohol"] for those who are not of age.


This presents some interesting legal questions: -- ["ArlenAbraham" aa] 
 * is this entrapment?
   * This would not be considered entrapment by any conventional legal interpretation, as entrapment requires that the target be somehow coerced into doing something he/she arguably would not have done had the government not coerced them out of their normal behaviour.  No matter how much the minor whines, its not coercion.  This is the definitive answer I got from Professor Spriggs (pre-law/"POL150 series" professor here) when I asked him about this specific circumstance last week.  Entrapment is a deplorably misunderstood topic claimed erroniously far too often. -["KrisFricke"]
 * if the shoulder tapper is asked "are you working for the cops?" do they have to answer honestly?
 * if the shoulder tapee asks the shoulder tapper "are you of age?" and the shoulder tapper answers "yes, i just forgot my ID" and is thus not ''knowingly'' providing an underage person with ["Alcohol"], is it illegal?


The ["40 ounce Meal Plan"] (aka buying booze for Freshman in exchange for swipes into the ["Dining Commons" DC]) is a form of shoulder tapping.
