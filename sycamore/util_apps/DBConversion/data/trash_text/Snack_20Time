Snack Time is an open forum discussion of current events and popular culture. All are welcome to attend. Snack Time is held four times a week from 10am-noon every weekday in the CoHo, near the salad bar. Awkward Third Hour times and days are yet to be announced. Past Snack Time topics have included stimulating debates on politics (both national and local-- all debates won by ["GavinJensen"]) muffin top discussions, Communist days,  Musical Mondays, Naked Wednesdays, and the ever popular Class-it-up Fridays. This quarter look for Crossfire Snack Time, a debate between ["MikeCharpier" FunnyChewingGuy] and ["GavinJensen"]; A synopsis of ethnic Tuesdays by ["MeganBoudewyn"] and ["MariamAlshawaf" Spoon]; And possibly the crowning of a new dictator or dictatress. ["GavinJensen"] is the current dictator,["NikkiGross" Fork] is head of the welcoming committee,and ["AndrewStromberg" Sunshine] is chair of the gorilla suit panel.["MichelleBush"] heads the "we miss Horchata" interest group.["MauraBrosnan"] is the matriarch of snacktime.If you know ["StaceyCox"] you will be brought to Snack Time, and ["AmandaGibson" SARS] will subsequently addict you. ["JoeySammut"] will make love to you at the drop of a hat.There are many other regular attendees of Snack Time, so feel free to edit yourself into this page. So please join us and all of your wildest dreams will come true. 
Special note: Wednesday sancktime is back on. Prepare to be naked.
ALSO- For all that missed Tuesday snacktime here are some haikus:

A tear in my eye /             
I sit alone at snacktime   /      
i want a bagel.


Bagel line is long   /         
Fuck Fuck Fuck I am hungry  /        
Where is everyone?
