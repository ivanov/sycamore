Hoa Viet is one of two Vietnamese restaurants in Davis (not including the pho line in the ["CoHo"]). The ["pho"] is pretty good although the broth is a bit oniony. The spring rolls aren't that great. Still, if ["pho"] is what you came for, then you should be pretty satisfied. The price for a large bowl is about $6, which is a good deal considering the serving sizes are ginormous. Good place for some dinner with a friend.

''The pho is pretty good, and comes in big bowls, as noted above. Good chinese-influenced Vietnamese dishes, too; I've found that Americans find those more familiar than the straight-up Vietnamese dishes. For great Vietnamese Sandwiches, check out ["Sunrise Restaurant"]'' - ["EricNguyen"]
