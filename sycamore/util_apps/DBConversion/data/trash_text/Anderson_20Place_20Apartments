Within the City of ["Davis"], Anderson Place provides fairly affordable housing. They have studios, one bedroom, and two bedroom units available. Be warned that the wait list usually fills up early in the year for open apartments. Tandem Properties manages the complex, and they aren't any better or worse than other companies. (They never show up to complete work as scheduled, but promptly remove wasp's nests.)
The units themselves are a bit shabby, but not disgustingly so. Other than a laundry room, the complex doesn't offer any amenities. Luckily Anderson Place is located across the street from ["Albertsons"], ["49er Video"], ["Guadalajara"], and ["Chamonix"]. Though in ["Central Davis"] technically, they are ''just'' on the south side of Covell.

''I live there for a year... not too bad, not to great.  I never had a problem with anything, and it is a fairly quiet setting.  ''
