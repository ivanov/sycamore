The awkwardly titled Sciences Laboratory Buildings are a set of buildings identical in architecture to the ["Life Sciences Addition"], sandwiched between ["Briggs Hall" Briggs] and ["Haring Hall" Haring] on central campus.

The 'Haring Barn' was [http://www-dateline.ucdavis.edu/011102/DL_barn.html apparently dismantled] to make way for its construction, and the mysterious yellow bat-filled barn will likely live on only as a legend to the future students of the University. 

"The Sciences Laboratory Building promises to be the most modern sciences teaching facility in California when it opens in 2004 in the campus’ Life Sciences District near the Life Sciences Addition and Briggs and Storer halls.

In addition to laboratory classrooms, the project will include student discussion rooms, learning centers, offices and a computer laboratory. An adjacent 500-seat lecture hall will be the largest of its kind on campus.

Most funding for the $57 million project comes from a voter-approved state bond. A Division of Biological Sciences fund-raising campaign seeks to raise more than $10 million to fund instructional enhancements not covered by state funding, including new facilities for the UC Davis Herbarium, office space for Undergraduate Educational Enrichment and Outreach Programs, and a computer laboratory that will be devoted to training in bioinformatics."

The lecture hall has the strange acronymic designation SCLBLH [SCiences Laboratory Building Lecture Hall].

Some minor touch-ups are still ongoing, but it's done and people are using it. Stuff below this line may eventually be added to Sciences Laboratory Buildings:Construction or Construction:Sciences Laboratory Buildings, or something like that.
  * Sciences Laboratory Buildings:Construction sounds cool.

Back when it was under construction, there was a sign there that looks like this.

This construction area is now sufficiently complete that students can bike/walk through it, and touch the buildings with their bare hands if they so desire.

The building seems to be nearly done at this point.  The main area had lights on in it and looked as if it was being used.  The lecture hall looked nearly completed, with only a bit of landscaping to be finished.

This tree in a box was found on the construction site.  Rumor has it that it's going to be planted.
