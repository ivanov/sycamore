The Spokes are the first and only Davis female a cappella group.  They were founded in January of 2004.  They've acted quickly and have a number of original arrangements.

A cappella means that the group sings without guitars, or, um, sitars.  Or any other kind of instrument.  Yes, even jugs.  Just voices.
