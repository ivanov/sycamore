Keith Shively is an ["ASUCD"] ["Senate" Senator] (Elected Fall 2004), and the first one in recorded history to be elected as a conservative. Conservative senators (notably ["Christopher Goren"]) have been elected in the past, but they've always kept their political beliefs on the downlow until elected.  Some, like former ASUCD President ["Sara Henry"] remain "in the closet" until their farewell speech.  Others, like Goren, whup out their throbbing conservatism as as soon as they are in the Senate and proceed to thrust it proudly about.

Aside from marketing himself as a conservative, Keith had another campaign trick up his sleeve which has been declared by many observers to have been the best $14 ever spent on an ASUCD campaign -- He took out an advertisement on [http://www.thefacebook.com].

Part of the secret to his success may have been his consultant, ["George Andrews"], who in the past has worked on large campaigns in the "real" world, such as ["Michael Dugas"]' campaign for Congress in 2004.  Keith's campaign was also spear-headed by extensive get-out-the-vote efforts on the part of the ["Davis College Republicans"] (DCR). 

Keith has a [http://www.keith4senate.com/ website] for his senate campaign.

He is also a member of ["Alpha Gamma Omega"] (AGO), a Christ-Centered Fraternity.

 * From what I can tell, he's a nice guy.  Not everyone dresses up for senate meetings, tie and all, just what they consider to be important or formal occasions.  He's left a good impression on me so far, let's hope we continue to see lots of good things from him. - ["MarieHuynh"]
 * Yay for Keith! He came to ["GASC"] ! He is willing to learn and work with everyone, I like it when he smiles too. - ["JenndelaVega"]
 * Keith seems like a nice person, albeit, perhaps a klutzy one. Last year I lived in ["Tercero"] as did Keith, and EVERY time  saw him he had some sort of cast on, or other injury-related item. Crutches, casts, ace bandages, you name it! Would love to hear the story behind those... - ["AbbyLawson"]
