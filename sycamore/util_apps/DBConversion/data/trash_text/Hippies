It is a matter of opinion as to if a college student who is a hippie for four to eight years, and then goes off to practice law in a power suit and raise 2.5 kids in a suburb ever really was a hippie.  That said, there are plenty of people in Davis who have been buying earth friendly goods since the late 60s/early 70s when the hippie movement started.

Many Hippies ''come'' to ["Davis"] for the ["Whole Earth Festival"].

It might interest you that the term 'Hippie' started out as a slur by Beatniks who were mocking the 'wanna-be hipsters'.  Thus, by a certain logic, there can be no such thing as a 'wanna-be hippie', as they are, by label, all 'wanna-bes'.

See also: ["Hoopies"] for an analysis of the more Davis-centric form of hippie.
