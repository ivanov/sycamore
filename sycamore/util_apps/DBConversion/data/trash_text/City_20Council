The Davis City Council runs the show here in Davis. There's a mayor too, but the mayor position is just cycled through the council.

Current city council members:

  * ["Jim Antonen"] -- city manager
  * ["Ruth Asmundson"] -- mayor
  * ["Sue Greenwald"] -- mayor pro tempore
  * ["Ted Puntillo"] -- councilmember
  * ["Don Saylor"] -- councilmember
  * ["Stephen Souza"] -- councilmember

They have a homepage at http://www.city.davis.ca.us/meetings/agenda.cfm?c=18
