''49er employees: Fierce Service''

An independent video store in ["Anderson Plaza"] at the corner of Covell and Anderson, just a couple shops to the left of ["Taqueria Guadalajara" Guad].  The staff are rumored to give "fierce service" and are fairly knowledgeable and interested in ["Movies" movies] in comparison to the staff of some chain video retailers such as ["Blockbuster" Blockbuster].

Cutting up your ["Blockbuster"] card at the store earns you a free rental, which is a nice little perk.  49er has good prices on ["Movies" movies], too, since you aren't paying $4 or more to rent a ["Movies" movie] (except for new releases).

They have sections for films required by classes on campus, Art House Films, Adult Films, and a small selection of video games.  But the main difference between ["Blockbuster"] and 49er is that 49er has a lot more ''good'' ["Movies" movies] (and has them displayed much more readily).  ["Blockbuster"] prides itself on excessive new releases (the big-budget movies), and cares less about having a collection of classic/good film.  49er, while not carrying as many copies of, say, Spiderman 2, does in fact have a much better selection of really good, quality ["Movies" movies].

49er is also the place to go to get cheap, high-quality, used DVDs.  The racks of 'for sale' ["Movies" movies] are immediately in front of the registers and the ["Movies" movies] are rarely priced over $10.  ["Movies"] include the original packaging and can be exchanged if they're unwatchably scratched.
