= Overview =

The LSA, the Law Students Association, is an organization that consists of all ["law students"].  It contains the ["Law School" Law School's] student government, which consists of President, Vice-President, Treasurer, and various other offices.  

The other ["professional schools"] at UC Davis, namely the ["Business School"], the ["Medical School"] and the ["Vetrinary School"], do not have their own autonomous governing bodies.  In times past, LSA representatives have represented the interests of other profressional schools in important campus-wide debates, such as going ["Division I"].
