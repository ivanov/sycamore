Located on Hutchison Dr. next to the ["Life Sciences Addition"], the  structure will be six stories high and will be the largest parking structure on ["Campus" campus].

"The West Entry Parking Structure project for the UC Davis campus will hold 1,453 spaces and include a 20,800-square-foot office building to house the ["Transportation And Parking Services"] and UC Davis Police Department public safety programs, including a new emergency operations center.  The parking structure has been proposed to accommodate recent increases in student enrollment, faculty and staff employment and campus visitors. Construction will begin in January 2004 with completion expected in November 2005." ([http://www.dateline.ucdavis.edu/020703/dl_regents.html source])

The entire old parking lot has been removed and many supporting beams have been erected.  The foundation looks like it's being built.  The construction information sign was moved since the last update, likely due to the vandalism of the sign that took place.

Streetlights have been removed, fences have been erected, and one piece of heavy machinery stands pitted against the asphalt in the ultimate quest towards justice and parking for all.

Go, little dozery... backhoe... contraption. You can do it.
