Redfield Machine is the sort of garage that doesn't need to advertise. Chances are if you are already aware of its existence it is because a customer has shared their discovery with you. What they have discovered is a well run small operation that treats their customers and their customer's cars very well.  They come out as the top-rated mechanic in Davis according to [http://www.cartalk.com/ CarTalk's] [http://www.cartalk.com/content/mechx/ Mechanix files].
