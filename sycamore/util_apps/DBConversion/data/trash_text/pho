Pho is a Vietnamese noodle soup with beef.  Proper pronunciation is closer to ryming with the word "duh" rather than "bow".  Usually comes with a plate of fresh herbs and lime slices to toss in as you see fit.  Sometimes a bit heavy on the seasonings, depending where you go, but really good as long as you're not vegetarian or vegan.  Veg pho just isn't the same.
