The Great Wall of China is arguably the best Chinese Buffet in Davis.  The main reason for this is that as of 2003, it was the only one (Hings being the other) to offer General Tsao's chicken.  Now, a chinese buffet isn't a chinese buffet without the general Tsao's chicken.

They offer a number of other items, most of which (with the notable exceptions of the fake crabmeat wontons and the hot-and-sour soup) are not very good.  Their buffet is usually around $7, and if I remember correctly, you can get a to-go box which, if you don't waste room on rice, will fit copious amounts of whatever sort of meatstuff you want to put into it.

For dinner, their special isn't bad, assuming you pay the upgrade to get general chicken instead of King Pao or whatever.
