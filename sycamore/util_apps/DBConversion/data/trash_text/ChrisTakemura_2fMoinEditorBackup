Pump it Up (PIU for short) is a rhythm game by Korean company Andamiro.  It bears a strong resemblance to ["DDR"], but uses five panels instead of four.  DDR fans occasionally refer to Andamiro as "Fauxnami."

There's only one PIU machine in the Davis area, and it's in the ["MU Games Area"].  Initially, this was a "Pump it Up Exceed" machine, but was quickly upgraded to "Pump it Up Exceed 2".  This made several people very happy and was widely regarded as a good move.

["TravisGrathwell"], ["KennethWaters"], and ["ChrisTakemura"] can often be found clustered around the machine.

Costs two tokens ($.40) to play.
