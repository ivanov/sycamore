L.E.A.D. stands for Leadership, Empowerment, Activism and Determination.  It is commonly known as one of the two major political parties (the other being ["Student Focus"]) on campus when it comes to ["ASUCD"] Senate elections. L.E.A.D.'s goal is to improve the campus environment for all students and to advocate for on behalf of students in city and state politics. 

LEAD's mission statement:
 "Our approach and philosophy towards student government is based on respect, equal accessibility, and acceptance for all. We recognize the fact that student issues extend beyond the boudaries of the UCD campus. 

 We understand that our university environment is composed of many different views, and acknowledge that the expression of such views is necessary for positive change. 

 Thus, we are dedicated to supporting progressive ideals, which allows us to move toward this resolve."


Lead was formed in 2000, with the initial candidates Matt Huerta and Erica Alfaro (["ASUCD President" presidential]).  For more info, http://votelead.com
