Shortly after ["Canseco"] broke up, ["TeddyBriggs"], ["GonzaloEyzaguirre"] and ["OtisCaldwell"] still wanted to rock! The one word that describes this unique 3-piece : YEAH. Sheer brilliance leaks from these guys, their heads..leaks from, their heads. They only practice the day of the show and smash your face into fun, dancable songs. Never giving you what you expect, these guys love to switch it up, you never know who will play what instrument for the next song!

They've played:
 * ["Delta of Venus"] cafe on B street with the ["Zim-Zims"] and the Black Plastics
 * The ["Pirate Ship"] various times
 * ["Plainfield Station"] twice

["TeddyBriggs"] was also in Rooney, way back in the day.  He's also in the ["Zim-Zims"].

Gnartoon plays rockin' rizzle.

-----
Sadly, they embodiment of coolgenius, ["OtisCaldwell"], has moved to Iowa and thus ends the saga of Gnartoon. They were going to play their last show at ["720"] but the ["davisnoisepolice"] ruined the fun. Fortunately Anderson road in a convergent nexus of cool and the show was moved just down the road to the ["Pirate Ship"].
