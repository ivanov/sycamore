Toomey Field is right next to the ["Hickey Gym"] and across the street from the ["Social Sciences and Humanities Building"].

Built in the 1950's, Toomey Field is still used today for UCD ["UCD Athletics" Football Games], Lacrosse games, and Track Meets.

With the [http://www.californiaaggie.com/article/?id=7107 new multi use stadium set to be built in 2006], Toomey field will be used only for track and field events upon completion of the new arena.
