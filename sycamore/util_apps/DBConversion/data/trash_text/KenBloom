Ken is a Computer Science Engineering undergraduate student, a member of ["Davis College Republicans"], and the most obvious Orthodox Jew on ["Campus" campus].

When he graduates at the end of Spring 2005, god willing, he hopes to go to [http://www.yhol.org.il/yhol.htm Yeshivat HaMivtar] for a year, and then to graduate school to earn a PhD in Computer Science.

Ken updates the ["Chabad of Davis"] page on the wiki, Chabad's almost official website.

''2005-01-28 18:57:40'' [[nbsp]] hey, its better if you leave pages to people with the approriate space in the middle. example: Paul Amnuaypayoat should be the name of my page, not PaulAmnuaypayoat. --["PaulAmnuaypayoat"]------
''2005-01-28 19:03:16'' [[nbsp]] The only thing is your username should be linked to a page giving at least some information about you ;)   --["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2005-01-29 21:50:19'' [[nbsp]] Paul, OK. If I had more edit comment space, I would have said "rename it back if you don't like it", and it would have remained linked to your username because renames create a redirect page from the old name to the new name. --["KenBloom"]
