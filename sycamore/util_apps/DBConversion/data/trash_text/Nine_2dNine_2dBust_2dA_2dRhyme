'''GETTING STARTED'''

This game is very similar to King's Cup, but much more lyrical.  Arrange a deck of playing cards face down on a table.  No organization or order is required--just throw 'em out there.  Place an empty cup in the center of the table.  This cup is called the King Cup, not to be confused with the King's Cup.  Each player grabs their favorite drink and takes their place around the table.  The first player draws a card, turns it face up, and must do the action as dictated by the card. Each card value (suits don't matter) indicates a separate action.

'''RULES'''

'''2-You''' (Point to someone, they have to drink).

'''3-Me''' (Player who drew the card drinks).

'''4-Floor''' (All must slap the table/floor/roommate's ass; last to slap must drink).

'''5-High''' (All must raise hands; last drinks).

'''6-To the Right''' (Person to the right of the player must drink).

'''7-To the Left'''

'''8-Pick-A-Mate''' (Player chooses someone and starts drinking.  They must drink for as long as player do).

'''9-Bust-A-Rhyme''' (Player says a rhyme, (ie I have a cat.  His name is Matt).  Next player must add a line to the rhyme.  If a player cannot add a line quickly, or at all, they must drink).

'''10-Rules''' (Player gets to make a rule that all must abide by).

'''J-Categories''' (Player chooses a category (ie, brands of Mexican beer), each player must name an item in that category.  The first person who cannot think of an item must drink).

'''Q-Questions'''

'''K-King Cup''' (Pour some of your drink into the middle cup).

'''A-Community Drink''' (All players drink).

After the first card is drawn, play goes counter-clockwise around the table.  Or, clockwise.  Whatever floats your boat.
P.S. Be careful what you're drinking when you play this game.  Mixing (Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, Screwdrivers, Mike's Hard Lemonade and Baileys, for example) can be lethal and/or disgusting!
