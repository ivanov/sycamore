It is rumored that there was a murder in a driveway of Radcliffe Drive during the winter of 2003-4. Neighbors report it happening but the police seem to have covered it up. Please post information if you have it.  

 *["TaylorStreet"]: My friend who lived on Radcliffe claims that the body was found in a car in front of a house that allegedly housed a meth lab. 

    ''I recall this being heavy in the rumor mills, but never seeing anything confirmed about it.  Internet rumor?  Davis Enterprise has zippo.  I'm thinking of visiting the Davis PD this week to confirm/deny/detail these entries. -- ["JabberWokky" jw]''

     I currently live in the house that was a "meth lab", ["Acadian Properties"] told us that it house crack heads who were evicted and put in jail for property violations. I wonder if it is true that there was a murder in my driveway. - ["JackHaskel"]
