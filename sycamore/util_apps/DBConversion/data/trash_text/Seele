''Seele'' is the undergrad literary magazine at UC Davis. It is an annual publication of poetry and prose by UC Davis students. It gathers submissions in the fall, puts them together in magazine form in the winter, and distributes it in the spring, usually attempting to have it out by ["Picnic Day"]. It started in 1997 and eventually replaced the local magazine ''A Light Left On.''

The word ''seele'' is German for ''soul.''

The deadline for submissions to ''Seele'' is probably very early January. Don't hesitate and if you are interested  download a submission form from their [http://seele.ucdavis.edu/ offical website] and drop off your submission at 177 ["Voorhies Hall"].

    *Acceptance of submissions has been extended until January 28, 2005.

The magazine is funded by ["SPAC"]. [http://seele.ucdavis.edu/] is their official website.
