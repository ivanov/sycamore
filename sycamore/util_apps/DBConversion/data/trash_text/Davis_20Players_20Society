Davis Players Society (aka: DPS) is an all male social group on ["Campus"] whose members claim to be "the shit"... or at least some of them do. The Davis Players Society, modeled off the Westmont Players Society (["Kalen Gallagher" Kalen's] High School), has selected ["Kalen Gallagher"] to be their public face, as the love affair that ["Rob Roy"] has with him saves DPS from any public scrutiny.


= History =

Supposedly, The Davis Players Society was created not long after ["Kalen Gallagher"] and several of his Westmont High School cohorts arrived on campus in the fall of 2001, give or take a few months. According to this school of thought, the group is modeled off of the "Westmont Players Society" that ["Kalen Gallagher" Kalen] and his friends  started back at his high school in San Jose. Not everyone agrees with this, so the best resolution to the issue would perhaps be to go directly to the ["Kalen Gallagher" source].

Today, the society has grown beyond Westmont High School alumni, and occasionally holds gatherings like DPS ["Poker"] Night, and once and awhile you may even see a DPS intramural sports team as well. They also occasionally hold formals (i.e. parties) as well. The first known formal held by DPS would be the DPS Spring Formal. The night consisted of dinner in a hick (but only because every woodland restaurant is hick) restaurant in ["Woodland"] and then a party in ["Sorrento"] in which one was crowned the ["King of Tercero"] (the housing area in which ["Kalen Gallagher" Kalen] lived) and then for the main event, the naming of the DPS King and Queen. Post-crowning, over $300 worth of alcohol (give or take a wee bit) was consumed. In December of 2004 they attempted to organize fancy "Fall Ball" but had it postponed three times, and eventually postponed indefinitely, because everyone is so studious.

Davis Players Society was responsible for the creation of several [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_Instant_Messenger AIM] screen names that cataloged the parties for the evening.  {{{UCD Party Scene}}} being the most notable.  DPS is also commonly used in such screen names. Some have mixed feelings about this invention and complain that the people attracted to parties through the service are ["Bros" not precisely the kind of attendees that were desired].


= Public Perception =

With such a controversial attitude, the perception of the group varies quite a bit depending on how you view the acts that DPS seems to revel in, as well as your relationship (or lack thereof) with any of the members.  

Outsiders have observed:

 *  ''To the outside observer the group seems like the typical ["Fraternity"] where a bunch of ["Bros"] try to get some ["Ass" ass]. A ["Freshmen" freshman] in 2003 had a large sign in his ["Dorms" dorm room] window advertising that he was a member of the society.''


While members have stated: 

 * ''To the outside observer the group seems like a collection of Davis's most upstanding students. A ["Freshmen" freshman] in 2003 had a large sign in his ["Dorms" dorm room] window advertising that he was a member of the society, and was known to have gotten much respect as a result.''

["Bros"] have observed:
 * ''As an observer the DPS simply seems to be an association of guys who banned together for the sole purpose of shameless self promotion; their only objective being the emotional fulfillment associated with popularity. The ultimate goal being uber-popularity for the sake of popularity... and future drunken rememberance. - ["ErnBro"]''          

True... don't hate. Actually, we're not trying to be popular... you don't even know who the members are, aside from Mr. Gallagher, and none of us are trying to get our names out there. Apparently, your theory is flawed.

A definition of the word "player" can be found at the [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=player&r=f Urban Dictionary]. For those seeking a less-obscure source, the definition of the word "player" can also be found online at [http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=player Dictionary.com]. We can only speculate as to what the original creators of the Davis Players Society meant for their personal definition of a "Davis Player".

While often used as a back slapping "good ol' buddy" complement, the term "player" refers to a certain type of sexist male. One is a "player" when one "plays" women for fools by having sex with them without showing them any respect. In essence, it requires treating women as sex objects.
