There are a bunch of computer labs all around ["Campus" campus].  Some labs, like the ones in the ["Memorial Union" MU], are 'open access' -- meaning any UCD student can use them (they require a login/password).  There are other labs that require you to be a member of a certain department or group, such as the ones in ["Kerr Hall"].

= 'Open Access' Labs =
These labs don't have staplers, so if you're going to print out a paper, you should ["Campus Staplers" find the nearest stapler].
 * ["Memorial Union"] lab - over by the ATMs and ["Quad Phone 1"]/["Quad Phone 2"].  Open 'till 12AM.
 * ["Olson Hall" Olson] labs - there are 3 labs and a 'print station'  on the lowest floor of Olson.  During the day they are usually being used by classes.
 * ["Hutchison Hall" Basement Hutchison] - One always open access lab and 2 that are often used for classrooms.  Sometimes classes only take up 3 rows of computers, so the back few rows are available for use.  
 * ["Hart Hall" Hart] - pretty much always in use, but they have some media stuff the other labs don't have.
 * ["Shields Library" Shields] - usually not too crowded due to widespred useage of the database computers for general-purpose web surfing.
 * ["Meyer Hall" Meyer Media Labs] - Often open since they are off of the central campus.  These do have classes in them sometimes but the computers have video editing and web-page making software that other labs don't have.

There is [http://csifdocs.cs.ucdavis.edu/tiki-view_articles.php a page] showing if the machines are in use.
