The Green Belt is the name given to a nearly continious strech of parks and ["Bike Paths" bike paths] that strech across most of ["North Davis"].

It can be seen pretty well on the [http://www.city.davis.ca.us/gis/bikemap.pdf bike map](PDF) available from the City of Davis, in the portion reproduced below:

It's pretty easy to get lost in the Greenbelt.  Bring a map or, when you inevitably get lost, go out onto one of the adjoining streets and follow the cars until they lead you back to civilization.
