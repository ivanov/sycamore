This might be one of the only international foods stores in Davis, but they are a good store.  
They carry a lot of Middle Eastern, Mexican, Indian, and some Asian foods.  They carry plenty of boxed "mixes" so somebody can prepare their favorite ethnic foods at home. 

They also carry newspapers in Arabic and Hindi music and VHS videos.
