MeganBoudewyn is the most amazing person in Davis. Her smile lights up a room like an energy efficient hallogen light bulb. She is fun to be around and will make you laugh until you break a rib. You should be her friend, because you would be lucky to know such a caring person. She is an important attendee of ["Snack Time"]. She also is the owner of the infamous "boob coat", which needs to be seen to be believed.
