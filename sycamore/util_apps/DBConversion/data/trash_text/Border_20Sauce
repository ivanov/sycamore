'''Border Sauce''' refers to the ["Hot Sauce"] packages of ["Taco Bell"].  This sauce is rather vinegary but does marginally improve the taste of ["Taco Bell"] food.  The sauce is not actually very hot which is presumably why it is called "Border Sauce" rather than "Hot Sauce".

The sauce comes in three flavors, ordered in ascending spiciness: 
  * '''Mild''' - ''Yellow Packet'' - Quite weak.  The most obvious vinegar taste of the three Border Sauces.
  * '''Hot''' - ''Orange Packet'' - More of a chili pepper flavor.
  * '''Fire''' - ''Red Packet'' - Some spiciness, ''even more'' chili pepper flavor.

''While I typically prefer spicier sauce, I find that the Hot sauce has more flavor than the Fire sauce, which I attribute to there being more onions in the Hot sauce.'' - ["MikeIvanov"]

''Yeah, I agree.  I don't think the Fire is hotter in any meaningful way, and it tastes worse.'' - ["JaimeRaba" jr]
