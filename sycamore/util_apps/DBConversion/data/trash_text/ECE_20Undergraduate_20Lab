More commonly referred to as "1101" or "that place where I try to make the computer do stuff but it doesn't do what I want it to", the ECE (Electrical and Computer Engineering) Undergrad Lab is located in ["Kemper Hall" EUII] on the first floor, in rooms 1101 and 1105. It's where many Electrical and Computer Engineering students spend their days, nights, and weekends. Undergrad Electrical Engineering type labs, which do work regarding circuit simulations, often end up working here.

The hours are 8 AM to 11 PM Monday through Thursday, Friday 8 AM to 7 PM, and on Saturday and Sunday it's open 10 AM to 6 PM Most of the activity on Sunday is after noon. It's always busiest at 6 PM, at which time the lab closes on the weekends

There used to be a problem in the labs regarding their shared applications, where if too many users were performing activity at once the server would crash for fifteen minutes, meaning that it went down exactly at the worst time (while a 40-student lab is trying to get work done).

''Used to?  Fifteen minutes?  bwahahahahahha...  They screwed me big time.  As of Fall '04, they had problems with the server that took care of undergrad accounts so accounts froze when the most people needed it.  They also ran out of licenses for Altera and screwed me even more.  I was told that they ordered something to fix the problem that cost something like $40,000 but wouldn't have it installed and fixing the problems until winter quarter. '' - ["MarieHuynh"]
