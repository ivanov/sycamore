Was the house where Shove (see omnibus records) practiced and buried statues and then became a noise venue.  Evolved in a more rock direction as the Varicocele Records Dude moved on, and then an awful lot of Portland / Seattle bands. I know I missed at least 2 show lineups. Somehow affiliated with the radio station?  Well known for having the most over the top craft services trays for the bands, include baked beans and wicked mixed drinks.
