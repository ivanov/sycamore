Po is named so because she looks like an ["Possums" opossum]. She lives with the Z twins (["SharonZimmerman" Sharon] and ["AmyZimmerman" Amy]) and ["ScottBiggart" Davis Coeds Scotty]. But she belongs to Amy. 

Po shares a cage with ["Endora the Rat"] and misses Delores the Rat, who passed away in November of 2004.
