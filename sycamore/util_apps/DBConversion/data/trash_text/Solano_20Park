Located in the southeast corner of the main UC Davis campus, Solano Park is one of the two apartment complexes primarily for regularly enrolled students with children; the other family housing apartment complex is ["Orchard Park"]. Solano Park offers very basic yet affordable one- and two-bedroom apartment living in a surprisingly community minded environment. Includes lots of lawns, trees, and a couple of playgrounds for children. Because the rent is at the low end of the scale for Davis, there's a long waiting list to sign a lease and the list is prioritized in the following order:
||1)  Students with children,||
||2)  Married students/domestic partnerships - documentation required,||
||3)  Graduate students no children,||
||4)  Undergraduate students no children||


Note: The railroad tracks run right along the western edge of the apartments.  Expect to hear and often even ''feel'' trains passing regularly.

''Note:''The complex has been repainted since these pictures.  It is now more of a toasted marshmellow color with a teal trim.
