According to the [http://www.chl.ucdavis.edu UC Davis Community Housing Listing], East Davis is "North of I80, East of Pole Line and North of E. 8th, East of J."  In other words, it's everything North of I-80 and East Of J Street except for the square bounded by East 8th, J, I-80, and Pole Line.  This square is part of ["Downtown" Downtown Davis].
 * I don't entirely agree with CHL's definitions of Davis' sections.  For example, according to the website Downtown is "North of I80, South of E. 8th, Between A and Pole Line."  I don't think Downtown should extend all the way to Pole Line.  I don't think it should even extend to J Street. -["RishiTrivedi"]
 * I don't agree with this either. Traditionally, East Davis is anything east of the railroad tracks, and north of I-80. Bob Dunning likes to refer to the section of town immediately east of the tracks, south of Fifth, and ending at L Street as "Old East Davis," but no one I know other than Bob Dunning actually calls it that, and I've lived in Davis most of my life. Downtown traditionally is the square bounded by B to the west and H to the east, Fifth to the north, and First to the south. Long before many of us were born, the actual downtown comprised G Street from Second to Fourth, and Second from F to G. The rest of the area between that and the university was primarily residential until during the 50s and 60s. -- ["CentralDavisite"]

Lots of people live in East Davis. There's a Burrowing Owl Reserve there too. Owl's gotta live, man.
