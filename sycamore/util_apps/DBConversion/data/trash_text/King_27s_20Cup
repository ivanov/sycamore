'''MATERIALS'''

 *1 Deck of playing cards

 *1 large cup

'''GETTING STARTED'''

On a table arrange an entire deck of cards face down around a large empty cup. Each person has a turn drawing a card, and every card drawn corresponds with an action (see key below). Whether it is making a rule, or giving out drinks, each card makes people do something.

Whenever a King is drawn, the person who drew the card pours as much of their drink as they would like into the large cup in the circle of cards. After this is done, the king card is balanced on the edge of the cup.

The goal of the game is not to get the last king, as drawing the last king means you must then chug the King's Cup!

The only other rules are: that if you knock the Kings off the cup on accident (either while pouring or other) you must drink what is in it! Also, if you break the circle of cards (so they arent all touching) then you must take a drink.
