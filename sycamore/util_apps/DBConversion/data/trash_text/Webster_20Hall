Webster Hall is part of ["Cuarto"]. Webster can hold 6 people per suite and it looks similar to Emerson, with a three floor building with outdoor hallways facing a pool in the middle. Webster is also home to the Education Academic Theme Program on its first floor. Overall, a nice intimate place to live.
