For a ["Night Time" late-night] quick snack, there are three possibilities in Davis:  ["In-N-Out"], ["Jack in the Box"] and, of course, Del Taco.  Del Taco is a chain that originated in Barstow, Calif., a city mostly notable for being on the way to Las Vegas.  Del Taco and ["Jack in the Box"] are the only true 24 hour drive-thrus in Davis, although it seems that the food at Del Taco isn't quite as good at night as during the day.  This is perhaps due to the employees having to deal with so many ["Potheads" high] and ["drunk"] people, or the employees being ["Potheads" high] and ["drunk"]. 

["JaimeRaba" jr]:'' The best things on the menu are chicken soft tacos, spicy jack chicken quesadilla.  The healthiest thing on the menu is a bean and cheese burrito (which comes in two sizes, the larger of which is 99 cents). If you accumulate enough ["Del Scorcho"] salsa packets, you can pour it into a bucket and use it for budget chips and salsa.''
