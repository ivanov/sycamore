== Text Formatting Rules ==

Leave blank lines between paragraphs. Use {{{[[BR]]}}} to insert linebreaks into paragraphs.

You can render text in ''italics'' or '''bold'''.
To write italics, enclose the text in double single quotes.
To write bold, enclose the text in triple single quotes.
__Underlined text__ needs a double underscore on each side.
You get ^superscripted text^ by enclosing it into caret characters,
and ,,subscripts,, have to be embedded into double commas.

To insert text without reformatting in a {{{monospace font}}}, use three curly braces:
{{{
'''No''' markup here!
}}}

For more information on the possible markup, see ["Help On Editing"].

=== Example ===
{{{
__Mixing__ ''italics'' and '''bold''':
 * '''''Mix''' at the beginning''
 * '''''Mix'' at the beginning'''
 * '''Mix at the ''end'''''
 * ''Mix at the '''end'''''

You might recall ''a''^2^ `+` ''b''^2^ `=` ''c''^2^ from your math lessons, unless you head is filled with H,,2,,O.

An { { {inline code sequence} } } has the start and end markers on the same line.

A code display has them on different lines: { { {
'''No''' markup here!
} } }
}}}
