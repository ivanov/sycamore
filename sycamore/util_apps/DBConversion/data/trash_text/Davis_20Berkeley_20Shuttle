The shuttle provides transportation between the University of California ["UC Davis" Davis] and ["UC Berkeley" Berkeley] campuses. Carrying students, faculty, staff, and intercampus mail it makes twice daily '''weekday''' trips. 

'''AM Departures'''

7:30 a.m. leave UCD 9:00 a.m. arrive UCB

11:30 a.m. leave UCB 1:00 p.m. arrive UCD



'''PM Departures'''

2:15 p.m. leave UCD 3:45 p.m. arrive UCB

6:30 p.m. leave UCB 8:00 p.m. arrive UCD

The times for arrival are very conservative, usually the trip takes approximately an hour and not one and a half hours as stated. Departure times are followed strictly.

To make sure you get a seat on the shuttle go to the website and make a reservation. Speaking from experience, you don't really need one, even if the shuttle looks full on the reservation website it is almost never full on the date of departure (many people reserve and never come). 
Either way, with or without a reservation, you need to purchase a shuttle ticket at:


[[center(begin)]]
||<:> Cashier's Office [[BR]] ["Dutton Hall"] [[BR]]M-F 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM [[BR]] (530)752-0460||    ||<:> UCD Ticket Office [[BR]] ["Freeborn Hall"] [[BR]] M-F 10:00 AM - 5:00 PM [[BR]] (530)752-1915||    ||<:> ["TAPS"] [[BR]] M-F 7:00 AM - 5:00 PM [[BR]] (530)752-8277||
[[center(end)]]

A one way ticket is $5.50.

Now this may not seem like much, except for those people who need to get to ["UC Berkeley" Berkeley], but this is an awesome way to save money for a trip into and past the ["Bay Area"]. Example: taking ["Amtrak"] from Davis to San Jose costs $21. Take the shuttle to Berkeley, take the downtown Berkeley ["BART"] to Millbrae ($4.10), transfer to ["Caltrain"] and arrive in San Jose ($4.25), total cost $13.85. And the savings and convenience increase when you need to get to San Francisco (~$8.65), SFO ($11.00), Redwood City, Palo Alto [[heart]], Mountain View (all $12.60), and many other Peninsula locations.
