We're everywhere.

We're at the ["Senior Center"], we're at the ["Trendy Restaurants"], we're in line at the supermarkets, at the ["Parks"], running our dogs in the ["dog park"], riding on the ["Bike Paths"], attending local churches. 

We volunteer with ["Citizens Who Care"] and other charity organizations.  We attend theatrical events, especially the yearly ["Citizens Who Care"] [http://www.dcn.davis.ca.us/go/care/Concert.html Winter Concert] and the ["Davis Musical Theatre Co."] shows.

The only place where we aren't broadly represented yet, is on Davis Wiki.  

Many of us have already raised our families, so we aren't found at school activities, or up to date with the local music scene.  But we're an important part of the town social structure.  I hope that more of the "mature Davisites" will find this web site and make their presence known.

''2004-12-09 13:59:57'' [[nbsp]] I absolutely agree with the above comment.  We are especially hoping to promote interaction between Davisites and UCD students. - ["MikeIvanov"]

''2004-12-12 16:18:38'' [[nbsp]] How long does it take a Davisite to "mature"? I know quite a few who are above the magical age of "40" who are still raising their families, or for that matter, have just started one. I know many who wouldn't call themselves "mature" yet either! As for me, you can count me as "semi-mature"; I'm not a UCD student, but I'm under 40 still. - ["CentralDavisite"]------
