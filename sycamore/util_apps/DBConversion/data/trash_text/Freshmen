As at all other schools, Freshmen are first year students. Freshmen at ["Campus" UC Davis] often live in the ["Dorms" dorms].

Claims that the proper plural form is "Freshmans" rather than "Freshmen" (by analogy with, e.g., "Musselmans") have gone almost entirely unnoticed.  The proper collective noun is "a clump of freshmen," unless someone can come up with a better one.

How to spot a Freshmen:[[BR]]
  *Afflicted with the ["Freshman Stripe"]
  *Wear dorm-related acessories such as those blue ["Reg Card"] necklace holders
  *Huddle together like penguins around the intersection of ["Russell" Russell Blvd] and ["La Rue" La Rue Rd], bound for ["AM PM"], ["Frat Parties"],["The Graduate" The Grad] and who knows what else
  *Working their way toward the ["Freshman Fifteen"]
  *Attempt to ride in the opposite direction in bike circles during the first week of school
  *Unable to find ["Navin's Copy Shop"] ''(although this also applies to ["Transfer Students"]).''
