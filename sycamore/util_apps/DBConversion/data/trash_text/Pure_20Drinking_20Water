City ["Tap Water"] is not acceptable to many ["Davis"] residents.  One option for purer drinking water is to buy ionized water from ["Supermarkets"] for around 30 cents a gallon.

== Purified Water in Bulk ==

 * ["H2O to Go"] -- $0.48/gallon, reverse osmosis, charcol filter and UV light
 * ["Davis Food Co-Op"]
 * ["Nugget"]
 * ["Safeway"]
 * ["Albertsons"] -- $0.30/gallon

== Home Purification Systems ==

 * ["Target"] -- Faucet filters and counter-top purifiers usually cost about $30 here, with replacement filters about $15 a pop. However, they last pretty long, and you never have to worry about running out of potable water.
 * ["ACE Hardware"]

== Bottled Water ==
  
 * ["Cafe Roma"]
