Hart Hall sits just outside ["The Quad"], next to ["Wellman Hall"].  You're likely to have any sort of class in Hart, provided it's not too huge.  Hart contains the departments of Chicano studies, American studies, African American and African studies, Asian American studies, Women's studies, and Human and Community development.

A cool thing about Hart, aside from its beautiful exterior design, is that it's got an audio/visual lab containing computers, scanners (including slide/negative scaners^1^), and videotaped lectures.  Hart's also got the C.N. Gorman Museum (which is all that old looking stuff you see when you walk in).

The people who work for the ["Campus Safety Escort Service"] chill in Hart during the night, all dressed in their orange vests.


Renovation:  The building was renovated sometime in the recent past to look like it does today.  Before it took on the somewhat Spanish/Mission style, it looked a lot like the ugly Hunt Hall.  The University, when it puts its mind to it can do some awesome renovations.  ["Shields Library"] is another awesome example of this.
