KFBK 1530 AM [[BR]]
Sacramento, CA

KFBK is the local conservative talk station owned by ClearChannel.  ["KSTE"] is their somewhat less political sister station.

 * 9am to Noon - Rush Limbaugh
   * The famous and infamous political commentator got his start in talk radio in Sacramento and as a result often references local areas.  Thrives on controversy and a reputation as the public relations arm of the "conservative movement".

 * Afternoon drive - Tom Sullivan
   * Tom Sullivan is worth mentioning simply because he is one of the core driving forces in Sacramento, the nearest city to Davis.  He is technically a financial consultant, but seems to pop up in the news all the time in relation to various development projects and proposed laws.  He seems to support a strong downtown, which means plenty of music venues.  He also leads many of the charity drives in the greater Sacramento area.


Most of the rest of the schedual is made up of various lesser known conservative talk show hosts, both local and national.
