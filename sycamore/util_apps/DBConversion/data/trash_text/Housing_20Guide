I have had the worst luck with roommates and so here is a huge post about the places I have liked here in Davis and a bit of experience.
 
 On roommates:
 Make sure you talk about policies of smoking, pets, drug use, weapons in the house (seriously, I didn't want my 19 year old crazy roommate to have a gun--they did), how bills will be split--these have ALL been issues for me in the past. 
 If you have any doubts or arguments with roommates about money or rent before you move in, seriously consider NOT living with them. The problems only get worse.
 
 Culture also plays a part, so discuss different habits if you are going to be rooming with people with a culture different from yours. It can be a very enriching experience, but educate yourself on types of food, expectations, etc. before moving in just so you have no surprises.
 
 Where to live:
 I have lived in: The dorms, a house in Davis, an apartment in Davis, and a private home in Woodland. 
 Living in private homes with live in landlords has its benefits, but sometimes the negatives outweigh the positives. Live in landlords usually have washer and dryers, include all bills in the rent so you can accurately budget, etc. They tend to be anal about who comes over/what time you come home/how much electricity is used/etc because it is their own home. I would not choose this option again in the future. It's almost like having parents again, and you don't have the same power since you aren't equally responsible for the place, like when you share a lease equally with another roommate.
 
 I now prefer Davis even though Woodland has a sorta nice feel to it (i.e. more laid back, not so busy, more mainstream stores, and PLENTY OF PARKING!), the time/money you spend on gas/parking permit/driving home to take a shower and get ready for a party with that hot frat bro/sorority girl/livejournal user/random guy from myspace/whatever it is that you shower for just to go turn around and go back takes up a lot of time and energy. It is cheaper and generally nicer to live in Woodland, but time and car wear considered, it breaks about even if you were to get a somewhat pricey place in Davis. It gets foggy on 113 and is always about 10x worse in the country then it is in Davis. 
 
 
 Since a lot of you have asked questions about apartments lately, I'll hopefully make this a bit easier for you. 
 
 This post contains:
 -Phone numbers, names, and addresses of (almost) every apartment complex in Davis
 -Places I've recently looked at and/or called or lived
 -My opinions about management and the apartments
 
 Remember this is my opinion and I do not intend to discourage anyone from any particular place, as my tastes may be different from other's tastes. This is just a guide. I'm not disclaiming nor giving any libelous statements towards any complex < / trying to legally cover my butt >
 
 A few good places to check out housing is
 chl.ucdavis.edu, The Davis Enterprise, Craigslist.org, the bathrooms on campus, the corkboards on campus, and The California Aggie. You can also search for the property company kingproperties.com, davisrentalhotline.com, tandemproperties.com, etc. You can call and ask what is open and the properties will let you know and sometimes how you what they have. Also, the websites often have floorplans of complexes.
 
 Keep in mind you're mid quarter, so people are desperate to get out of places. Rent and deposit are often negotiable. Rent.com offers a $100 rebate if you use the site to find your place. See the websites for details.
 
 If you are poor (i.e. get a lot of financial aid) you can apply for low-income housing, utilities, cable, etc. Many complexes in Davis have them, so it's best to ask about low income and get on waiting lists ASAP. It can take years to have your name come up.
 
 Month to month leases are possible in Davis, just a bit harder to find. 
 
 In addition, depending on where the apartment/house is located, you can often get a 2-bedroom medium quality place for the same price as a really nice one-bedroom apartment. If you want to live by yourself, this is a nice option to have because you can always make an office out of the extra room, or decide to get a roommate later without having to move.
 
 
 
 
 Keep in mind I looked at studios and one bedrooms unless otherwise stated. I'll write notes at the bottom of select complexes with my opinion. I also have been looking RECENTLY; many of these places will have openings and waiting lists for next fall. When I state "not available" or "none available" or "no 1brs available" they basically mean the same thing, I mean no 1brs available when I called--I'm just being grammatically inconsistent. Remember you should call if you are interested in case something has come up since the last time I called. Prices are estimates and may change before you get around to looking. This is just a guide.
 
 The best way to tackle (for me) apartment hunting is to get a big list of every one (provided here) and print it off. Leave room for notes. Talk to friends who have lived in Davis and start scratching off the crappy places. Then start calling every place, know what you're looking for (do you like upstairs/downstairs, do you like a dishwasher or washer/dryer in the place, if they allow pets, etc), and ask what is available. Then go look at a place and see if you like it. Keep notes and bring a paper/clipboard with you. I also take notes on the free handouts the complexes give you (the ones with the floor plans). I have seen so many places that I wouldn't remember what I liked if I hadn't took fairly decent notes.

 Chautauqua Apartments
 717 Alvarado Avenue
 Davis CA 95616
 530 - 758 - 2950
 I looked at two apartments at this place. I absolutely loved the layout of the studios with lofts. The reason I didn't pick this place is because the front doors are sliding glass and do not deadbolt. If you are a female looking for your own place, not having a front door and only having a sliding glass one is weird. Also, there are very very few windows in the place. The layout is cool, and is spacious (two story townhouse feel, even though it's a studio with loft). There are currently two people trying to sublease their apartments, call the office. I recommend seeing both apartments if interested in this complex.

 None available
 
 Hanover North Studios
 1801 Hanover Drive
 Davis, Ca 95616
 (530) 758-7320
 This is above Suds right behind Albertsons. They have private parking for the residents, a gated entrance, a few laundry rooms close to the apartment, etc. I didn't like the inside of the apartment, but that's because I'm picky. The manager was very nice (I looked at a studio) and seemed to be on top of maintenance issues. This is the same redheaded lady mentioned before. Private patios, good location, nice manager. Not the studio for me, but definitely worth looking at.

 I have a friend who lived here in a two bedroom. I thought it was kinda crappy, but it's right near campus. Worth checking out if you want to live near campus.
 
 Ivy Towne Apartments
 801 J Street
 Davis CA 95616
 530 - 756 - 2654
 I have lived here. My apartment was near the front and fairly nice since I didn't hear the train often. We had brand new carpet and flooring since the people before us had a pet that tore it up. I had horrible roommate problems here and the management didn't do as much as I thought they could to help me get out of my situation (they did work out a break of lease deal with me--but that was after I moved out and risked being sued by my roommate and the complex). I eventually had to move out and break my lease (you can break the lease; they don't tell you that, you usually have to pay a break of lease fee and lose your deposit. I ended up paying somewhere over 500 to get myself legally out of this situation). I tried contacting the owners multiple times and never had a response--management's hands were tied by owners who would not address tenant issues--this made me feel like they were much more into money than caring about people's well being. 
 When my friends and I first looked at the place, it was a pretty color and had a wonderful manager (we signed leases then). Then they switched managements and painted it baby kaka green with purple and other random colors. I've had four other friends that lived here, and they had crappier apartments. Maintenance man was nice, pretty good about fixing things. Rent was decent, and it's near bus lines. I have really awful memories of this place, so I would NOT live here again, but for those who get along with roommates, and get a nice unit, you may enjoy living here.
 
 J Street Apartments
 1111 J Street
 Davis CA 95616
 530 - 756 - 2100
 Basically same apartment/class style of Cranbrook and Ivy Towne. Okay to live in for your first year on your own, but you WILL want to upgrade unless you get a good unit or absolutely love it.

 I checked these out a few years ago. They seemed a little dirty. May have changed by now. They come furnished.
 
 La Salle Apartments
 880 Alvarado Avenue
 Davis CA 95616
 530 - 753 - 5155
 I have friends who live here and have seen two one bedroom units here and one multiple room unit here. 
 I know a girl looking to sublease her one bedroom that is in good condition, so comment if you want me to send her your contact info. Decent sized room, dining room, living room, kitchen, and bathroom. The places are cute, moderately priced for the condition, and are near bus lines and shopping centers. I would live at a place like La Salle.

 1424 Wake Forest Drive
 Davis CA 95616
 530 - 758 - 3100
 The manager Patrick was very very nice and talkative. He seemed to know every tenant and to keep the places in good condition. They weren't new, but kept very clean with upgraded stoves, new carpet, etc. Every unit is a one bedroom, and it has huge closet like doors that open into a large living room, so you can either have it set up like a studio or like a one bedroom apartment. They are having specials right now if you sign the lease. It is a bit expensive to live here (something around 800) but it is very near campus (right by Cuarto). I would live at a place like Oxford Parkside.

 I ABSOLUTELY LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE!!! I checked out a studio, and it was wonderful. It had a washer and dryer in the unit, tile kitchen, huge bathroom, huge kitchen, but a very small living room/bedroom combo. It is somewhat far from campus with a rather infrequent bus line. I met the manager, the maintenance man, and office lady. All were very nice. I would most definitely live at this complex. It runs a bit expensive though.

 Expensive, but a decent area and a nice manager. It seemed to be a fairly classy apartment complex, but it was too expensive and too far away for my tastes. The two bedroom was VERY spacious, and was a corner unit so it had lots of windows. Private patio and beautiful grounds. Runs about $975 for a studio, $910 for a one bedroom (I think one is available soon), 1095-1175 for two bedroom one bath. Washer and dryers in some units.

 These are being renovated. Will be nice, but are very expensive. One bedrooms run 900-1k. Very near campus and will be nice. Washer and dryer included. 
 It's too expensive for one person, may be decent for a couple or for many people. Worth checking out.

 VERY VERY VERY NICE AND HELPFUL MANAGERS! The places are western style, I have seen a 4 or 5 bedroom unit (I can't remember which) and a one bedroom unit. The larger unit is townhouse style, and very cute to decorate. The one bedrooms are recently renovated and have nice closets. Cute grounds, plenty of parking. Most definitely worth checking out.

 a few complexes may have been left out, but this is the best list I have found. 
 
 I have lived in a house under King Properties--they were pretty good most of the time. It did take over a week to get our a/c fixed, but I think it had more to do with the owners than the property managment. Best rental experience/roommate experience I've had in college except maybe the dorms.
 
 I would NOT live at a place managed by PHM. I saw three places (one home, one townhome, and an apartment type place) and they were seriously the most ghetto I have ever seen.
 
 I hear FPI managment is pretty good.
 
 There are many others, look online in the directory for Davis property management to see more.
 
 Okay done.
