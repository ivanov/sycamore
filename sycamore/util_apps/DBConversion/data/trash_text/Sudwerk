Sudwerk, short for Sudwerk Privatbrauerei Hubsch [Sudwerk Private Brewery Hubsch (family name)], is Davis' local microbrewery. Popular among UCD students is the Dollar "Pint" Night which is on Wednesday night. Arriving before 9pm to avoid the cover charge may or may not work. Sometimes they'll charge you if you plan to stay. The "Pints" on Dollar "Pint" Night aren't actually pints. They are 12 ounces instead of 16 ounces.

People from Germany say that this is the only beer that they will drink in California.  

Be sure to check out the Doppel Bock, a seasonal Sudwerk holiday brew.[[BR]]

Food is mainly German items: Sausages, Warm German Potato Salad, Sauerkraut, etc.[[BR]]
