Armadillo Music is a small and friendly independent record store.  They sell music, videos, and videos with music, along with diverse other items.  The selection varies, but they are always willing to special order something not in stock.  They accept Cash, Check, Master Card, and VISA!  If you're strapped for cash they also buy used CDs and DVDs.  

Used CDs that don't sell quickly end up in the Bargain Bin near the door.  Often, amazingly good music can be found in this non-alphabetized rack for under $6, with some CDs selling for as cheap as $2.  If you're looking for a gag gift, there is no shortage of Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys here.  Cruise often, as the Bargain Bin is frequently replenished.
