''1''.  While many who even ''live here'' refer to the buildings collectively as ''re-gun'' the correct pronounciation is ''ray-gun''.  The pronounciation was properly dictated to 2004 ["Summer Advisors"] by the daughter of the actual William M. Regan.  They pronounce their last name the same way former President Reagan does.

This is another good example of where the university doesn't seem to be able to count. Segundo (spanish for "second") is actually the oldest of the dorms, and Primero Grove Apartments is newer than Cuarto. So what justifies the naming order? Is it perhaps North Hall and South Hall (which were originally dorms)? No! In fact, on the current site where Primero Grove Apartments sit now, was a previous dorm area -- newer than North and South Hall, but older than Segundo -- which have since been demolished. ''(I thought I remember hearing that they burned down, but I'm probably wrong -- ["KenBloom"])''
  * I thought Primero came first and then were "renovated" into the Primero Grove Apartments that we have now.- ["RohiniJasavala"]
  * The first Primero was torn down. The current Primero was built close to the location of the first one.- ["JasonAller"]
