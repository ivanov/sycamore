The department of Molecular and Cellular Biology contains three majors: ["Genetics"], Biochemistry, and Cell Biology.  There are a large number of faculty currently in this department and doing research in it.  A large number of the professors for the BIS 100's series are in this department.  In fact, Chancellor ["Larry Vanderhoef"] was in the MCB department.

The undergraduate advising offices for these majors are in 156 ["Briggs Hall"].  

They offer various seminars through the quarter that adress issues in their field which are free to students and faculty.
