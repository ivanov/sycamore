[http://soccer.org American Youth Soccer Organization] is a volunteer organization dedicated to creating a safe, fun opportunity for youths to play soccer.  Naturally, the local chapter ([http://www.davisayso.org] Davis AYSO) is always looking for volunteers... no experience necessary (really!), though you may need to attend a (free) training session for some positions.
