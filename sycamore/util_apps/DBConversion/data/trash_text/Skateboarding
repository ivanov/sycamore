Most skateboarding in Davis happens at the ["Public Skate Park"].  Technically, skateboarding is illegal on the sidewalks (at least downtown), as the stenciled warnings will remind you.

Other locations that people often skate at include the steps in front of the ["Physics and Geology"] building. One can also find skaters hanging out around ["Central Park"].

Longboarding is a popular alternative to ["Bicycling" biking] around town. 


The ["Bike Paths"] are nice and smooth for fast skating.
	
["Ground Zero"] is the only skateboard store in town.
