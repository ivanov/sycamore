''2004-12-19 01:33:17'' [[nbsp]] I think we should try to drop many of the "Davis" prefixes, as in "Davis Wilflife," "Davis Tap Water", "Davis Urban Legends."  This site is entirely about Davis, so that part is mostly implied. - ["MikeIvanov"]

''2004-12-19 06:00:22'' [[nbsp]] hmm.  good call. - ["ChrisTakemura"]------
''2004-12-20 16:45:58'' [[nbsp]] Can we have a clarification on how far discussion should go under items?  Is debate on a topic appropriate to this Wiki, or is it counterproductive to the concept of "comments eventually being reworked into the entry"?  Not complaining, but I'm thinking that a statement regarding discussions that may be never-ending might be useful. - ["JabberWokky"]------
''2004-12-20 17:12:01'' [[nbsp]] no really, ["JabberWokky" Wokky] and i are going to have a BBQ  - ["ArlenAbraham"]

''2004-12-20 17:18:16'' [[nbsp]] I'll bring the beer... I have a fridgetop full of good microbrews and Sudwerk. - ["JabberWokky"]------
''2004-12-20 19:22:37'' [[nbsp]] Thoughtful, non-redundant discussion is welcome.  If two people are just replying to each other over and over, then that seems wasteful.  They ought to consider reworking their original arguments to stand as a single block. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2004-12-20 21:46:56'' [[nbsp]] I'm down for a get together but it should be sometime after Jan. 6th. Mike, I agree that Davis should be dropped from more things. But for Wildlife, I feel that something needs to qualify it. Maybe Town Wildlife would be better. My aim with it was to catalog the Urban Wildlife, not all wildlife in the area. - ["JackHaskel"]------
''2005-01-01 15:52:12'' [[nbsp]] ["Vote: Favorites" Vote] on what a new feature should be named. --["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2005-01-02 23:46:46'' [[nbsp]] I think the Davis prefixes should come back on most things.  "Davis Tap Water" for example.  That's simply what it's called.  And this wiki is about things other than things entirely within Davis.  Rather, it's about the universe from the perspective of the Davis community. --["JaimeRaba"]------
''2005-01-03 00:16:22'' [[nbsp]] Jaime:  I agree that it's not just about Davis, but with certain things it's assumed we mean Davis, since that is certainly the focus of the wiki.  With something like tap water, I doubt we're going to be talking about Sacramento Tap Water and Dixon Tap water, and if we do, they can be all on one page.  Unless, of course, each topic became huge and needed its own page. --["MikeIvanov"]------
''2005-01-27 23:58:46'' [[nbsp]] It would be nice to have the option to add ending times on the events board. Editing entries would be cool too.  --["JackHaskel"]------
''2005-01-28 11:33:27'' [[nbsp]] What do you think of adding a comment field to the bottom of pages or somehow differentiating between a description of something and community commentary? I appreciate knowing whether a place or event is worth my time/money, but it's also helpful to have that somewhat separate from the event listing itself. --["AlphaDog"]------
''2005-01-28 13:47:33'' [[nbsp]] You can use {{{[[Comments]]}}} to do that on any page you want. Also, there's a convention for comments added where there is no comment box: Italicize your text, and sign with a link to your username. And don't freak out about the places where that's just a really hairy distinction between fact and opinion. --["KenBloom"]------
''2005-01-30 14:20:10'' [[nbsp]] what about having our own little class rating section? but unlike other websites that do it by teachers, we can do it by classes.  --["Adam Gerber"]

''2005-01-30 14:52:09'' [[nbsp]] I'm not sure why "Town whaterver" is better than "Davis whatever."  Davis isn't even a town.  I can understand how seeing a bunch of things cluster around Davis in the index can be boring, but how is "Town" better?  I think Davis Water makes sense!  I mean lots of Davis people get their water from elsewhere, but it's the Davis water that has problems.  I think the Davis prefixes should come back.  This is especially true as Sacramento folks increasingly look at this website.  It just helps keep things precise. --["JaimeRaba"]------
''2005-01-30 15:30:56'' [[nbsp]] I'm not sure whether "Town whatever" is very good, but it serves to distinguish the town from the University.  As much as I like the great information we have about Sacramento, I think we have to keep things in the context of Davis, and dropping the Davis prefix from many page names implicitly signals this.  This is not to discourage people from other cities, but we do need to keep the focus on Davis.  If someone is interested, Philip and I would be glad to help start a Sacramento Wiki or a wiki for other cities. --["MikeIvanov"]------
''2005-02-01 12:34:55'' [[nbsp]] Following up on the commentary about Davis community versus a broader regional community, it sounds like postings about events and opportunities in the surrounding area is discouraged. Am I mistaken? My 2¢: As a member of the Davis community, I don't really feel like my life is defined by the geographic boundaries of this city and actually appreciate notice of opportunities within driving distance or even further. --["AlphaDog"]------
''2005-02-01 16:32:17'' [[nbsp]] AlphaDog:  You are certainly not discouraged from posting about events in the surrounding area.  The discussion above has to do with the overall focus of this wiki.  Events that are interesting to Davisites are most welcome. --["MikeIvanov"]------
''2005-02-01 16:36:45'' [[nbsp]] Regarding the ["Sacramento"] events you posted in ["Regular Events"] -- I would say just make an ["Outskirts"] events section and put them there -- then when there's a lot just move it to a new page and link it from there.  I think for the ["Events Board"] any event in an ["Outskirts"] town is probably fair game ;) The reason it's important to distinguish is that many undergradauates do not have access to a car or good transportation to other cities to attend events, so think keeping Davis events as the most visible is good. --["PhilipNeustrom"]

''2005-02-01 17:13:37'' [[nbsp]] Wow! I didn't even know there were separate sections for different cities. Thanks for the clarification and good idea about the Outskirts Event section. I understand what you're saying about undergrads, but what about older students and undergrads with cars? Would it be appropriate to create a link at the bottom of something like the Events page to let people know that there are more events in the Outskirts section? --["AlphaDog"]
