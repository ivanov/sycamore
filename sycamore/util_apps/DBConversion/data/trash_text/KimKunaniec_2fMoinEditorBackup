About me:
 * I grew up in El Sobrante.  
 * I generally suck at visual arts, but tend to be a decent writer.
 * People like me better when I show up with food.  So I'm going to study to be a pastry chef.
 * I spent a ton of my time involved with ["ASUCD"] and CalPIRG.
 * I am 70% homebody, 30% partier.
 * I love Karaoke night at ["Cantina del Cabo"].  But I almost never sing, because I'm lacking that talent too.
 * I always have my nose in other people's business.
 * Some days, I think I have no life.  Other days, I think I have too much of a life.

Hey, I grew up in El Sobrante, too!  El Ratton Court was the street I lived on.  What kindergarden did you go to?  I bet we went to the same one. - ["PhilipNeustrom"]

I lived on Santa Rita for most of my life, and I went to Sheldon from kindergarten through 5th grade. - ["KimKunaniec"]
