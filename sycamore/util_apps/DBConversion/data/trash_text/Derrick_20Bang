["The Davis Enterprise"] entertainment editor is also the author of the critically praised "50 Years of Happiness: A Tribute to Charles M. Schulz."  In early 2004 he released his second book about Schulz, this one focusing on the cartoonist's early work after returning home from his WWII service: "Charles M. Schulz: Li'l Beginnings." 

In his former life, Derrick founded The Game Preserve, a retail Davis game-and-puzzle store, which was opened for 18 years.  He finally closed the business in January 1997, when he took over the full-time position as entertainment editor for ["The Davis Enterprise" The Enterprise]. 

Derrick has written film, television, Internet and general entertainment commentary for all three Davis/Woodland area newspapers since 1974, and still supplies regular columns and features to ["The Davis Enterprise" The Enterprise]. He also does freelance writing and research assignments for Charles M. Schulz Creative Associates, and writes and edits the newsletter for the Charles M. Schulz Museum, in Santa Rosa, California.
