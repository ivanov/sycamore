''Lower Division Courses''

 * 2A. General Chemistry
  * Basic chemistry. Almost all of high school chemistry is reviewed with only a few new insights.  Bear in mind - that's still a whole year smushed into ten weeks.  
  * If you liked this, you'll like Chem 110A and random chunks of Chem 124A.

 * 2AH Honors General Chemistry - A much smaller class - 100 students.  If you qualify based on the assessment tests, definitely take it.  The smaller class is worth it.

 * 2B. General Chemistry
  * pH (aka solution equilibria) and thermodynamics.  The MOST boring of the series and possibly the most difficult.
  * If you liked this, you'll like Chem 105/115, Chem 110C and parts of Chem 110B

 * 2BH. Honors General Chemistry - A much smaller class - 50 students.  If you qualify based on the assessment tests or your Chem 2A grade, definitely take it.  The smaller class is worth it.

 * 2C. General Chemistry
  * Electrochemistry, radioactivity, bonding and a whole mish-mash of other stuff.  The most interesting of the series because of the variety.  More concepts and not as many mundane calculations as in A or B.
  * If you liked this, you'll like 124A/B, Chem 105/115/125, and parts of Chem 110B

 * 2CH. Honors General Chemistry - A much smaller class - 25 students.  If you qualify based on the assessment tests or your Chem2A or Chem 2B grade, definitely take it.  The smaller class is worth it.  There are also two three hour labs each week instead of one.  REALLY fun experiments that actually mean something.

 * 99. Special Study for Undergraduates - DO UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH!  Now.  It is the only way to get into grad school.

''Upper Division Courses''

 * 105. Analytical and Physical Chemical Methods - Lots of the same types of calculations as in Chem 2B.  Very little new material, just a lot of more in depth labs and write ups.  Very long theory sections.

 * 115. Instrumental Analysis - More 105.  Very little new material.  Long write ups.  Neat experiments.

 * 125. Advanced Methods in Physical Chemistry (4) - More spectroscopy.  VERY cool stuff.  VERY long write ups - only 4 experiments in the quarter.

 * 110A. Physical Chemistry: Introduction to Quantum Mechanics - Quantum Mechanics.  If you like math, have a good working knowledge of Math 21A-C, and enjoy theoretical stuffs, it is a fantastic class.

 * 110B. Physical Chemistry: Properties of Atoms and Molecules - It helps to have taken 124A first.  Not the most interesting of the chemistry classes.  More spectrocopy from 110A,  a throwback to 124A and a preview of 110C.

 * 110C. Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics, Equilibria and Kinetics - More and harder Chem 2B.

 * 124A. Inorganic Chemistry: Fundamentals - This is one of those classes that focuses a LOT on a very few basic ideas - if you don't understand symmetry and point group assignment, you will have a very difficult time drawing  molecular orbital diagrams (the final and hardest topic of the class).

 * 124B. Inorganic Chemistry: Main Group Elements - So far so good - going into the details and nuances of the main group elements (s and p fillers).

 * 124C. Inorganic Chemistry: d and f Block Elements - Spring. 

 * 124L. Laboratory Methods in Inorganic Chemistry - Spring 

 * 128A. Organic Chemistry - Organic chemistry is evil.  Run away.

 * 128B. Organic Chemistry - Organic chemistry is evil.  Run away. As fast as you can.

 * 128C. Organic Chemistry - Organic chemistry is evil.  Run away. As fast as you can.  In the opposite direction.

 * 129A. Organic Chemistry Laboratory - Organic chemistry is evil.  Run away. As fast as you can.  In the opposite direction.  Now.

 * 129B. Organic Chemistry Laboratory - Organic chemistry is evil.  Run away. As fast as you can.  In the opposite direction.  Now. Hurry.  

 * 129C. Organic Chemistry Laboratory - Organic chemistry is evil.  Run away. As fast as you can.  In the opposite direction.  Now. Hurry.  While you still can.  Don't say I didn't warn you.

 * 131. Modern Methods of Organic Synthesis -  If you didn't like, nay ABSOLUTELY LOVE as though it were your twisted country cousin, or were not very very VERY nobel prize winning good at Chem 128/129 -DO NOT WHATEVER YOU DO TAKE THIS CLASS.  I'm dead serious.  I still don't know what possessed me...

 * 121. Introduction to Molecular Structure and Spectra - Good class.  Lots of hard theory and very little reading of actual spectra.

 * 150. Chemistry of Natural Products - VERY cool class.  Natural products can do almost anything.

 * 199. Special Study for Advanced Undergraduates - DO UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH!  Now.  It is the only way to get into grad school.

''Perhaps this page would be more useful with personal accounts/summaries of classes instead of a verbatim copy of the ["General Catalog"].  After all, you can just link to the ["General Catalog"] and the website for the major to give people this information'' - ["PhilipNeustrom"]

I second what ["PhilipNeustrom"] said - ["BryanBell"]
-----
Yes!!!  Please, add your reviews of these classes.  Unless you liked organic chemistry.  All people who liked organic chemistry will be shot on sight. - ["SarahHillard"]
