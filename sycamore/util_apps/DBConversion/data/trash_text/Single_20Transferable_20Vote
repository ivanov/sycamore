Single Transferable Vote is the technical name for a voting system known locally and more commonly as ["Choice Voting"].  "Preference Voting" is yet another name.  Single Transferable Voting can be used in both single-winner and multi-winner elections.  In multi-winner elections, it is a system of proportional representation.  For single-winner elections, it reduces to the system more commonly known as ["Instant Runoff Voting"].
