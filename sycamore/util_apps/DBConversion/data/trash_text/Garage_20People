There is a Davis phenomenon in which people live in garages.

Such as:

 * ["GriffinWalker"] lives in the garage of the ["Pirate Ship"].

 * ["BudCutino"] lives in the garage of ["720"].
 
As you can see in this picture. Bud sleeps in the loft, many times with his girlfriend Caitlin: [[BR]]

  * I once lived there. -- ["RishiTrivedi"]

 * ["GarrettPierce"] lives in the garage at the ["Gay PD"].
