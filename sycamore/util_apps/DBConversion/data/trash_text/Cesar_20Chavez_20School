Chavez houses the district's Spanish Immersion program, and all classes are taught in Spanish. Previously, Spanish Immersion had been at North Davis Elementary, among other schools. Renamed for Cesar Chavez, this school used to be known as WDE or West Davis Elementary. WDE was a K-3 program; its sister school was WDI, or West Davis Intermediate, which is now known as ["Robert E. Willett School" Willett Elementary] (the school was named for a popular 6th grade teacher, the late Robert Willett).
