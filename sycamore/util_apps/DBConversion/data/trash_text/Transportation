Probably one of the most unique things about Davis is its transportation network. Legions of bikes and a fleet of ["double-decker buses"] are its signature features.

On campus, ["Transportation And Parking Services" TAPS] regulates both bicycle and motor vehicles.

== Bikes ==
Davis is well-known for its fleet of ["Bicycles" bicycles] and corresponding infrastructure. Everywhere in Davis is accessible by a bike lane or ["Bike Paths" path], including several ["Bike tunnels" tunnels] and ["Bike Overpasses" bridges] that span under/over roadways. Various intersections, the most prominent being ["Russell"] and ["Sycamore"], even sport a Green/Red Light specifically for ["Bicycles" bicycles]. The bike system culminates at the ["Campus" campus] which is closed to general auto traffic. Bicycle circles and lanes dominate the campus streets which become flooded with pedaling traffic between classes. Visitors are usually amazed at the sheer number and volume of bikes. See ["Bicycling"].

== Motor Vehicles ==
If you are driving a motor vehicle, you get to deal with ["Parking"]. It is best to park someplace and then walk or even better, if you have a bicycle, it would be easier to get around the downtown and campus area than having to find a parking space or pay to park. Be careful of time limitations.

== Walking ==
Some say everything in Davis is within ["Walking Distance" walking distance].

== Roller Blading ==
Many students skate and rollerblade to class on ["Campus"]. See ["Rollerblading"].

== Unitrans Bus system ==
Another novel aspect of Davis transportation is the bus system, ["Unitrans"], which runs several London-esque ["double-decker buses"] that operate on natural gas engines.

= Getting Out of Town =

== Car ==
If traveling by ["Automobiles" car], ["Interstate 80" I-80] West leads to the ["Bay Area"] and ends at the junction with U.S. Highway 101 in San Francisco.  ["Interstate 80" I-80] East heads toward ["Sacramento"] and ends at the junction with Interstate 95 in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey.  ["Highway 113"] leads North to ["Woodland"] and, eventually, to Seattle.  I-5 is about 12.5 miles east of Davis.  Heading south, it goes through the Central Valley, leading to Southern California and, eventually, the Mexican border.  Heading north, it goes through Redding, Portland, Seattle, and terminates at the Canadian border.

Note that cars are listed under "Getting Out of Town", as bicycles are usually faster than cars on Davis streets.  See ["Driving in Davis"].

== Regional Buses ==
["Yolobus"] is a countywide bus system serving ["Solano County"], ["Yolo County"], and ["Sacramento"]. ["Transportation and Parking Services" TAPS] also provides a ["Davis Berkeley Shuttle" shuttle service] to ["UC Berkeley"].

== Train ==
["Amtrak"] has three routes that run through Davis.  The Capitol Corridor, a commuter train, travels as far east as Auburn and as far west as San Jose.  The line makes the Bay Area accessable from Davis by connecting to the ["BART" BART System] in Richmond.  The California Zephyr also passes through Davis, going all the way to Chicago.  The Coast Starlight line runs between Seattle and Los Angeles.  To catch a train you'll want to go to the ["Train Station"].

== Air ==
Davis has a small ["Airport" airport] serving the university and city. For domestic flights, ["Sacramento International Airport"] is the nearest "major" airport.  Oakland International Airport, about 75 miles, is the next closest airport.  San Francisco International Airport, a major international travel hub and one of the busiest airports in the US, is 85 miles away.  San Jose International Airport is about 105 miles away.

== Bicycles ==
Amtrak has ["Bicycles" bicycle] racks on all of its Capitol Corridor trains.  The line connects Davis to the ["BART"] system, which also allows bikes on its trains (except during select peak hours).
All Yolobuses are equipped with bike racks.  They're actually pretty simple to use.
