Another term for "tail" which is another term for "getting some" etc. 

Get ass in Davis here:
 * ["Frat Parties"] - though you might get those ["Sorority Girls"], they are okay, too.
 * ["Bro Parties"] 
 * The ["Cantina del Cabo" Cantina] - lots of older college ass, probably free of freshmen
 * ["The Graduate" The Grad] - often filled with ["Freshmen"], but hey, people always need to eat at the DC
 * ["DavisCoeds" Davis Coeds dot com] - It's off the internet, but I know people who have gotten lucky without even having to risk human contact.  Plus it is a pretty cool site.

If you're on ["LiveJournal"] and like ass, you can check out the UC Dav''ass'' community: [http://www.livejournal.com/community/ucdavass/]  - beware, it isn't active at all.

ASS can also refer to the ["Aggie Student Store"] (see ["Glossary"])
