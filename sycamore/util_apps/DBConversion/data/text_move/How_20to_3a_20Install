= Getting the software =
Obviously, the first step is to download the software package.  This is painless.  The current stable release of the LocalWiki (whatever it's going to be called) software is located at ''here''.

Alternatively, you can obtain a bleeding-edge version of the software by checking it out of our [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] server.  Just type...

== Requirements ==
In addition to the LocalWiki software, you will need the following:
=== Things you likely already have installed on a standard Unix system ===
 * [http://www.python.org/ Python] (2.2.3 is what we're using)
 * A web server (apache)

=== Things you're going to need to install ===
 * [http://xapian.org/ Xapian API] - This is used for our search engine.  [http://xapian.org/download.php Download here].  If you don't have super-user privledges then you're going to have to do (if you're compiling the source) {{{./configure --prefix=somewhere local here}}}.
 * [http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm Python Imaging Library] - Used for images.  [http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm Download here].
   * To get this to install as a superuser I had to make sure my versions of tcl and tk were up-to-date. You can [http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/downloadnow84.tml download here] the latest versions and compile them from source.  If you don't have superuser privledges and your versions of tcl/tk are slightly out of date (or not installed), then you're going to have to play with a combination of screwing with Setup.in (then doing {{{cp Setup.in Setup}}} and then try running {{{python setup.py build}}}.  You might even have to edit {{{setup.py}}}.  I had some problems with this package (but managed to get it to install) as a non-root user -- but as root it was cake. Please put any problems you're having installing it here, or any success stories..--["PhilipNeustrom"]
