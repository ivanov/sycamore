Want to upload that nice, pretty, awesome photo you took, but you're bummed out that you have to shrink it down to post it in a page?  Well, just {{{[[Thumbnail]]}}} it!  Upload and image as usual (say, {{{image.jpg}}}), but then instead of using {{{attachment:image.jpg}}} you use {{{[[Thumbnail(image.jpg)]]}}}.

== Options ==
In addition, you can specify some things to make your life easier and pages prettier.  To set a size for your thumbnail, you simply add a maximum size (in pixels).  To give the image a caption, simply add a {{{"statement in quotes"}}}.  To say make the thumbnail forced to the left or to the right (it can look ''very nice'' like this sometimes), write {{{left}}} or {{{right}}}.

=== Example ===
So I upload the image as usual:

attachment:image.jpg

Then I write:

{{{[[Thumbnail(image.jpg)]]}}}

[[Thumbnail(image.jpg)]]
