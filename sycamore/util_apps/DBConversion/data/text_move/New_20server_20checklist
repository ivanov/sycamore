 * Try mod_python
 * Turn off every service we don't need
 * Setup automatic backup cronjob (per-day).  It should attempt to tar + gz all the site data and scp it to a couple offsite, stable locations.  Candidates?  codetoad@nasledov.org.. math.ucdavis.edu is good but we won't have accounts there for very long at all..How about we also scp it to our PIII machine?
 * Figure out how to turn on {{{suexec}}} for apache to execute commands ''as'' particular users of the system in a safe manner.  Also, we need to turn on User Directories ~/user .  This is important because we want non-root users of the system to be able to run wiki instances.
