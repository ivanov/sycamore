make 'Images' do exactly what it does now...?  -- maybe it should do something different now, no popups? --- so they dont lose their work?  (that's the main concern, right?--- so they can edit and add images at the same time without having to use a tabbed browser.
 -- maybe we can use xmlhttpdrequest crap?

Images can have thumbnail comments (table) as well as upload comments (stored in image table and done while uploading).
----
image areas don't have 'edit this page' but have the rest of the footer.  make a toggle thing for the footer.
