= Overview =
Sword and Sandals is a secret organization involving many of Davis' elite, including ["ASUCD"] officers and several chancellors.  Much like the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones Skull and Bones] at Yale University, the Sword and Sandals keeps the proceedings of its meetings secret and is used by the elite of the university to interact and discuss issues.  Several exposes published in the ["The California Aggie"] (the last was in 1993), as well as this wiki page, have diminished the secrecy of the organization. The group still exists today, but the effectiveness of the organization has been questioned.

= Before the meeting began =

[[Thumbnail(006_1.jpg,right,"The location and time of the meeting ('Sword and Sandals') was displayed publicly.")]] 

''["PhilipNeustrom" I] was leaked the location and time of a Sword and Sandals meeting, and decided to get some friends together to go and document, as best we could, the people and activities involved.  The following photographs and text is taken from a purely outsiders standpoint, as we never entered the meeting.''

The organization reserved ["MU II"], ["Smith Room"], ["Garrison Room"], and the ["Fielder Room"].  The main meeting took place in ["MU II"], and the other rooms were used for catering or smaller meetings.

While ["MU II"] is hardly secluded, this was, after all, a Saturday night -- practically no one was on ["Campus"] and the likelihood of someone stumbling by the meeting while it was in progress was minimal.  Of particular note is how well dressed everyone was.  The student members were wearing suits or nice dress clothes.  The ["ASUCD"] officials were dressed much better than they usually are for ["Senate"] meetings.

= The meeting =
[[Thumbnail(IMG_003_4.jpg,right,"Folks gather around and chat before everybody's shown up.")]]
The bulk of the meeting seemed to consist of gathering around tables and talking.  ["Kalen Gallegher"] (["ASUCD President"], ["Student Focus"]) was one of the first students to show up.  There was a small podium set up, along with a laptop connected to a projector. [[Thumbnail(IMG_1245.jpg,"Several unidentified individuals can be seen, as well as the laptop and projector")]]  [[Thumbnail(IMG_1270.jpg,"Everyone chatting and dining.  ["Kalen Gallegher"], Chris Ryan (["Sigma Phi Epsilon"]), as well as others can be seen.")]]

== The Garrison Room ==
[[Thumbnail(IMG_1142.jpg,right,"A document is read aloud to three unknown individuals.")]]

Perhaps the most mysterious of events unfolded in the ["Garrison Room"], adjacent to ["MU II"].  ["Kalen Gallegher"] and a number of other unidentified individuals headed into the room after the meeting in the main room had began.  First the lights appeared to be on, then they turned off and strange music was heard from within the room (''note:  not sure if the music was coming from the main room or this room in particular'').  Afterward the photo to the right was taken.

[[Thumbnail(IMG_0245.jpg,"Items left in the Garrison Room.")]]

After leaving the ["Garrison Room"], a number of items were left behind.  Three brown bags, three packets of soil, and a number of candies and coins were left there.  The bags looked to be originally taped together, and it is likely the items came from the bags. 

It is possible that the reading that took place, the music, and the brown bags filled with strange items was some sort of ritual.  After all, there were three people sitting in front of the bags in the first ["Garrison Room"] photograph (above right).

== A room gone dark ==
[[Thumbnail(IMG_0243.jpg,right,"A dark room with faint candles visible (click to see).")]]

Suddenly, after the meeting in the main room had been underway for a while, the lights went off.  It was then noticed that ''candles were lit''!  The room stayed candle-lit for 10-15 minutes.  The candles, along with the mystery of the Garrison Room, helped reinforce that while this organization has lost much of its secrecy in recent years, it is still filled with tradition and is alive to this very day.

[[Thumbnail(IMG_0244.jpg,"A closer view of the candles.")]]

After the lights came back on, their meeting proceeded as before -- much chatting, and socalizing. At this point one of our photographers was then asked by a member (who was on his cell phone outside at the time) ''"What are you taking pictures of?"''  This, along with the general lack of activity inside the meeting and the fact the photographers had prior commitments to attend to caused us to take off at this point.
