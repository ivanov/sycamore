This is a rough to do list for the next couple of days for me.  I keep it here so i don't accidentially lose it.

lost password thing?  keep it as a dictionary?  sure..maybe..yeah.
---
no filesize:  instead just the name

filesize goes on info page

 then make view & info work
then make delete work.
admin browser thing.--works?

---
footer for the image view thinger and the main normal image area.
----
make the normal image area thing window look okay inside the window.
----
make 'Images' do exactly what it does now...?  -- maybe it should do something different now, no popups? --- so they dont lose their work?  (that's the main concern, right?--- so they can edit and add images at the same time without having to use a tabbed browser.
 -- maybe we can use xmlhttpdrequest crap?
 -- What do we do when they click on the "attach an image to the page?" link?
----

Images can have thumbnail comments (table) as well as upload comments (stored in image table and done while uploading).
----
image areas don't have 'edit this page' but have the rest of the footer.  make a toggle thing for the footer.

-----

----
when viewing an image it first checks images then it checks oldimages for other info (old revisions)

do=restore&image=name.jpg
 * check if they can edit the page
  * check to make sure the image isn't already on the page
   * insert it into the images table again
    * person who restored is the new uploader/upload_time.
     * keep older image in oldimages and display that information when viewing the image.

----
after all image stuff:  test to see if it still works with images with weird characters in their names.  '&' and so forth.
----
rework RC to not use the current time to sort by and instead use the smallest time in allPages/other crap and the current time to compare to that in display.  this will allow it to be cached by mysql's query cache.
