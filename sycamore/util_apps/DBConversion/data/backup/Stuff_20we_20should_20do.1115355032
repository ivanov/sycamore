== refactor the parser ==
The parser is huge and ugly right now.  If you want to do some lightweight parsing of, say, a single string then you're in a world of pain.  Also, sometimes you want to use a subset of the parser.  text_html.py parser is derived from a base parser, but text_html is itself too complicated a parser.  There ought to be a layer in-between so we can plug and play with subsets of our markup for use in macros, actions, etc.

== move to a DBMS ==
Begin the move to a db backend (mySQL using InnoDB).  We're already hacking our way around this, and it's just going to get messier the more we go along.  Initial schema and basic integration will come soon.

== super easy stuff ==
--XFix thumbnail macro so that it converts PNG/GIFs to the right thing before scaling them, scales them, then converts them back to indexedX--
  We can consider this one done, although the file size for the resized images is still kind of large.  PIL is bad at compressing images.

== All-in-one imaging ==
Throw together {{{attachment:}}}, {{{borderless:}}} and {{{[[Thumbnail]]}}} into a simple, easy to use, {{{[[Image]]}}}.
