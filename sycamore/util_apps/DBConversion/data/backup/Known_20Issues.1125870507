 * make sure you can't login using the encrypted password (with {SHA} in front..)..
      * make sure the email-password thing (old) doesn't work and the (new) system does work.
      * need better logout thinger?
 * intuitive redirect labels (wikipedia)

= bugs = 
 * thumbnail macro doesn't have proper regexp for image captions with comas in them
 * thumnail macro also needs to work perfectly in alignment with the syntax for {{{attachment:a%20%image%20with%20spaces__and__these__things}}}
   * a particular one that it doesn't work with is {{{C__Documents%20and%20Settings_Leviathan_tercero.JPG}}}
   * works with that image referenced ''as'' {{{C__Documents and Settings_Leviathan_tercero.JPG}}} -- isn't doing %20 stuff?
 * Uploading from IE on windows can produce said ugly attachments. EW.
 * Sub-pages.  In general need to fix simpleParse.
 * Interwiki.
 * User Statistics on www.bearvalleywiki.org just doesn't want to update with pages that I have created, nor the time of last edit. Go to my wiki and you'll see the User Stat is definitely behind what Recent Changes would indicate. Mike Ivanov looked at it for a while. Didn't see anything obvious. 

= more general =
 * set up subversion completely.  document the code setup!

= speed fixes =
 * ["Title Index"], etc should be fast or turned off.  Do per-day generation of Wanted Pages, Orphaned Pages, and Outgoing Links.
