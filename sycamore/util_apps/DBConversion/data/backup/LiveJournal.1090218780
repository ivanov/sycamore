Livejournal.com (LJ) is the amazing journaling site that many UC Davis students waste their time on.  It used to be an exclusive site: access was granted if you knew someone with an invite code. But the admins saw it fruituitous to open the site up to EVERYONE. Lj-ers can update via an html page or through one of the many convenient LJ clients (programs that allow you to update without actually visiting the site).

The [http://www.livejournal.com/~ucdavis UC Davis LJ community] has gained notoriety amongst UC LJ communities and has appeared on ljdrama.com  The climate of the community changes drastically each minute and can have as many as 30 posts in a day. A very informational and social group; UCD LJ breaks the stereotypes about internet dating/meeting (sometimes enforces them on rare occassion).

We have LJ to thank for the many friendships we have today ;)

Perhaps the main problem with the UC Davis LJ community isn't the lack of moderation (or rather, some form of content control) but the fact it is being used for all the wrong reasons.  People post things knowing that they will pop up to the top of everyone's "friends" pages, regardless of how tired or unappealing the topic is to those subscribed.  I guess that it would work a lot better in some bulletin board format, wherein stupid inane shit gets rightfully passed to the bottom of the board.
