I am a recent graduate of UCD with a BS in mathematics.  Along with ["PhilipNeustrom"], I am co-creator of this project.

I enjoy math, programming, and gathering difficult-to-find information.

If you need to reach me, feel free to email me at mivanov''@''gmail.com or leave a note below.

= My Wiki Favorites = 
  * ["Meat Lab"] - apparently, a place on campus that sells cheap, fresh meat of all varieties.  I gotta check that out.
  * ["Good Ideas For Dates"] - for when I run out of ideas.
  * ["WiFi Hot Spots"] - good to know where I can log on when I'm out with my laptop.

= Fun fact about Mike Ivanov =
My original Russian name is Mikhail, which has as variants Misha and '''Mishka'''.  Not to be confused with ["Mishka's"] Caf&#233; in Davis.

''2004-11-24 08:44:51'' [[nbsp]] Every PC I've touched runs the java perfectly but mike should check into the support on a standard system..?  I don't know anything about java issues (except that microsoft fucked java) - ["PhilipNeustrom"]------
''2004-11-25 09:23:58'' [[nbsp]] Heya.  Nice site. :) Was wondering if you had heard of Epoz? - ["EmilySecret"]------
''2004-11-25 13:30:34'' [[nbsp]] Hey, great to see you here!  Yeah, we considered implementing a wysiwyg editor, but we feel it would rather complicate things such as attachments and links.  Plus Safari has a lot of trouble with JavaScript.  I'm not ''that'' familiar with Epoz, so if these concerns don't apply, let us know and we may well implement it. - ["MikeIvanov"]

''2004-12-14 05:38:01'' [[nbsp]] Orphaned Pages lists redirects as orphans.  Bug?  Feature?  Pretty low priority, unless it's a really easy fix. - ["JabberWokky"]------
''2004-12-14 05:41:57'' [[nbsp]] Are all redirects listed as orphans or just, um, orphaned ones?  It would be good to know.  But yeah, don't expect almost any fixes this week. - ["MikeIvanov"]------
