 * Fix huge rename bug.
 * fix paul's shit.
   * Needs to delete from the dictionary when pages are deleted
   * simpleParse needs to use the new linking code (this will fix a lot of weird stuff, too)
   * Needs to work on a request level -- so index.cgi/Page and index.cgi/PaGe both resolve to the same place.  This will make the %20 to _ switchover easier, too
 * Is the login stuff 100%? 
    * make sure you can't login using the encrypted password (with {SHA} in front..)..
      * make sure the email-password thing (old) doesn't work and the (new) system does work.
    * need better logout thinger?
 * intuitive redirect labels (wikipedia)

== Little things ==
 * Center should check for a full {{{-->stuff here<--}}} statement, rather than the individual arrows.
 * thumbnail macro doesn't have proper regexp for image captions with comas in them
 * thumnail macro also needs to work perfectly in alignment with the syntax for {{{attachment:a%20%image%20with%20spaces__and__these__things}}}
