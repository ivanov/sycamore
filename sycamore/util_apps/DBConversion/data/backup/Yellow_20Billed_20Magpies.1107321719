The Yellow-Billed Magpie is a species of bird found only within California’s borders. They can be found In the Central Valley, adjacent foothills, and ["Davis" Davis’] ["Dumpster Diving" Dumpsters]. The highly social birds prefer to build nests high up in trees, normally oaks. They are often found near roads, since Magpies are scavengers, and road-kill is easy pickens.
