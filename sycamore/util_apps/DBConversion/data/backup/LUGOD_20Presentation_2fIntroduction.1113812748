   * Lacking resources for the community
     * Uncreative, unoriginal, corporate-feel:  Davis411.com
     * Limited access.  Cannot create or contribute to existing resources easily.
   * Wanted:  Information, Creativity, and Culture.
 * Central idea:
     1. Freely accessible
     2. Freely editable
     3. User-friendly
