The ["ASUCD"] Senate contains 12 senators that manage a '''9.2 million dollar budget''' and officially do not embezzle.

As for elections, all undergraduate students at UCD can vote for anyone they want.  In addition to independent candidates, there are "slates" here at UC Davis -- akin to political parties.  They are (in 2004):

 * ["SOSSS"] - Official [http://orwell.wildninja.com/ website]
 * ["Student Focus"]
 * ["LEAD"] - Official [http://www.votelead.com/ website]
 * ["Friends Urging Campus Kindness"]

[[Thumb(winter2004senate.png, "Winter 2004-2005 Senate"))]]


Currently, six of the twelve seats are held by Student Focus senators, with LEAD controlling five seats and one seat belonging to independent ["Donald Cohen-Cutler"]. This yields a [http://www.cs.unc.edu/~livingst/Banzhaf/ Banzhaf index] of 60% for Student Focus, and 20% each for both Cohen-Cutler and LEAD, which may suggest that the power distribution in the Senate is out of tune with the preferences of the student body. Of course, this depends on one accepting Banzhaf's quantification of voting power.

After the newly elected Fall 2004 senators take their seats, LEAD's share of seats will drop to four, with the leftover seat being occupied by independent ["Keith Shively"]. Ironically, far from diversifying the range of interests represented on the Senate, the replacement of a LEAD seat with an independent increases Student Focus' power index to 66.67%, while reducing that of the others to a mere 11.11%.

If you were wondering, yes, this means that each independent has as much power as the entire LEAD block.

The Senate is responsible for voting on and creating bills and orders that say how ["ASUCD"] should operate.  Being a Senator is a very important job because of the sheer ''size'' of ["ASUCD"].

= Scandals/Corruption =

The ASUCD Senate has generated some interesting scandals recently.  These include:
  * The ["Senator Ackerman Scandal"] - theft of books by a senator
  * ["Lamargate"] - IRS investigation of illegal endorsement of political candidates
  * Fall 04':
   * ["Campaigning in Dorms Controversy"] - Campaigning in dorms by ["Student Focus"]
   * ["Election Statement Controversy" Elections Committee modifying candidates' statements.]

  * It is documented that some past members of the ["ASUCD"] Senate were invited to join the ranks of the secretive organization known as ["Sword and Sandals"].  It is unknown who in the Senate (if anyone) is currently a member, due to the secrecy of the organization.

= Election Information = 
The ["Elections Committee"] is responsible for elections matters.  The Senate is elected using the ["Choice Voting"] method.
 * The results for the 2004 election can be found in a [https://elections.ucdavis.edu/resultsf04/Fall%202004%20Round.htm hidden corner of the elections site].
 * The ["Davis College Green Party"] provides the [http://ucdgreens.org/ballotdata/fall2004.raw.txt raw data], along with other [http://ucdgreens.org/ballotdata/ senate election results], so you can rerun as many fantasy elections as you like.  It may be pertinent if some candidates are eliminated due to campaigning in the dorms.  Software to run the election using ["Choice Voting"] is available [http://stv.sourceforge.net/ here].
 * The next election will be held on February 23-24 and there will be 8 seats open instead of the usual 6 (due to the [#resignations resignations]).
