So, this is my little home on the Wiki.

I'm a ["Mathematics"] major here at Davis.

I have a ["LiveJournal"] which is at [http://livejournal.com/~codetoad].  I don't seem to update it as much as I should, though.

My email address is [[MailTo(philipn AT gmail DOT com)]]. My AOL Instant Messenger name is {{{CodeToad01}}}, and I'm on that fairly often if you want to chat.  For wiki-centric stuff, please email [[MailTo(daviswiki AT gmail DOT com)]] (for now).

= Some Favorite Pages =
 * ["Night Time"] - Find out whatff's open late at night!  Literally the most important resource in Davis :P
 * ["Davis Map"] - Too awesome to leave off this list.
 * ["Cleanest Bathrooms"] - An idea whos time has come.
 * ["Payphone Project"] - 2600 31337 factor.
 * ["Wikivangelists"] - I was lost and now I have found the path.

= What do I do on the Wiki? =
I make a lot of edits.  What do I usually edit?  These are my most common edits:
 * I link phrases and terms to pages in order to add more stucture.
 * I remove comments and try to integrate them into the page's body if possible.
 * I take differing viewpoints or arguments and attempt to find a common ground.  Nearly any argument or difference of opinion can be solved by merely expanding the writeup to be larger, more general, and less specific.  ["Students for an Orwellian Society"] is a great example (check out the revision history).

I also have a ["PhilipNeustrom:To Do" To Do] page that you likely do not care about.

== Note to self ==
''Davis from the Inside Out by William D. Diemer. National housing register, 216 F Street, PMB 17.  This is an interesting compilation of a ton of Davis related information that can be purchased for $15 at ["Newsbeat"].  I might buy it to help out with facts/info.''

[[Comments(Messages to me)]]
Have you thought about contributing a few macros etc. upstream to the MoinMoin project? -- AlexanderSchremmer [[DateTime(2005-02-13T21:48:35Z)]]

------
''2005-02-13 15:14:08'' [[nbsp]] We are going to have a full source release soon.  The problem is that moin's macro/action framework isn't too flexible, so a lot of stuff (with the ["Events Board"]) required global changes, as well.  We aren't going for back-moin compability, because we're really just intersted in making something function for our needs.  We essentially have a fork of the moin project, but I am more than willing to help moin folks with macros/actiions we have.  I wrote up some install instructions for our {{{[[Thumbnail]]}}} macro, so [http://82.165.250.53/src/ check it out] and tell me if it works (so I can revise the install instructions). --["PhilipNeustrom"]
------
''2005-02-13 15:19:06'' [[nbsp]] Someone called "Sun" tries to port it to MoinMoin 1.3 currently. --["AlexanderSchremmer"]
------
''2005-02-13 15:20:55'' [[nbsp]] I am looking forward to the source release ... --["AlexanderSchremmer"]
------
''2005-02-21 18:29:41'' [[nbsp]] What about a page on trolls?  I think through the normal wiki processes this is likely to shed light on who they really are, and light turns trolls to stone.  I doubt any of them are going to look "glorified" upon examination. --["KrisFricke"]
  * Whatever you'd like to do.  I just wanted to make sure that they are not legitimized or given undue attention.

''2005-03-08 02:10:39'' [[nbsp]] Now that there's a ["Barbara Boxer"] page I can see the word ''Senate'' as referring to more than just the ASUCD Senate --["AmeliaCarlson"]
------
''2005-03-10 23:38:27'' [[nbsp]] Sweet update! I like the new features. --["JackHaskel"]
------
''2005-03-11 11:08:04'' [[nbsp]] Also, everything is way more responsive. --["JaimeRaba"]
------
''2005-03-11 11:50:35'' [[nbsp]] I'm digging a lot of the visual changes too... more subtle notice on the redirects... more obvious edit lock warnings.  Two thumbs up here.  --["JevanGray"]
------
''2005-03-11 14:05:27'' [[nbsp]] i love the new redirect text --["ArlenAbraham"]
------
''2005-03-13 00:14:42'' [[nbsp]] the file sizes on all my images are too big. so i was trying to use the pic from the EU III page and put it on the civil engineering page. --["AshleyOrsaba"]
