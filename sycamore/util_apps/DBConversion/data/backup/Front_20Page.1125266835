Welcome to the [http://daviswiki.org DavisWiki.org] development wiki!  This is where we discuss development issues and try to make our wiki software work properly.

If you want to contribute to the code, see ["How To: Install"].  Our subversion repository is at http://daviswiki.org/repos. If you fix something or make a new feature, feel free to email [[MailTo(philipn AT gmail DOT com)]] a patch (for now.  Eventually we'll have a better way to do stuff).

We've got a bunch of ["known issues"] and ["stuff we should do"].

If you have not worked on the DavisWiki/RocWiki codebase, you might want to check out the ["Developer Overview"].
