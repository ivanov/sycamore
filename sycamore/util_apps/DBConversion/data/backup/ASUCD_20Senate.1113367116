= Power Structure  =

'' Needs to be updated yet again.  Move some of this info to ["Senate History"]. '' -["BrentLaabs" bl]

Currently, six of the twelve seats are held by ["Student Focus"] senators, with ["L.E.A.D." LEAD] controlling three seats and three seats belonging to independents (["Donald Cohen-Cutler"], ["AdamGerber" Adam Gerber], ["Keith Shively"]. This yields a [http://www.cs.unc.edu/~livingst/Banzhaf/ Banzhaf index] of 60% for ["Student Focus"], and 20% each for both ["Donald Cohen-Cutler" Cohen-Cutler] and ["L.E.A.D." LEAD], which may suggest that the power distribution in the Senate is out of tune with the preferences of the student body. Of course, this depends on one accepting Banzhaf's quantification of voting power.

After the newly elected Fall 2004 senators took their seats and vacancies were filled by Presidential appointments, ["L.E.A.D." LEAD's] share of seats dropped to three, with the leftover seats being occupied by independents. Ironically, far from diversifying the range of interests represented on the Senate, the replacement of a ["L.E.A.D." LEAD] seat with an independent increases ["Student Focus" Student Focus'] power index to 66.67%, while reducing that of the others to a mere 11.11%.

If you were wondering, yes, this means that each independent has as much power as the entire ["L.E.A.D." LEAD] block.

The Senate is responsible for voting on and creating bills and orders that say how ["ASUCD"] should operate.  Being a Senator is a very important job because of the sheer ''size'' of ["ASUCD"].

In order to truly understand the Senate, you'll want to look into ["Senate History"].
