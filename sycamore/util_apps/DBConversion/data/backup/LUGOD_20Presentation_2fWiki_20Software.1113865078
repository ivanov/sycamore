= Finding wiki software =
 * somewhat new concept
 * few examples of successful projects
   * software-wise:
    * MediaWiki -- huge, used by wikipedia
      * broke conventions (no CamelCase)
    * MoinMoin -- used by many in open source community
      * stuck to wiki traditions (CamelCase)
        * CamelCase makes sense when you're talkingAboutObjects
   * project-wise:
    * wikipedia
    * software documentation/open source community used wiki
