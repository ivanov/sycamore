Pretty much everything, unless noted otherwise, is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).  There are components, such as modules in Sycamore/support, that are under more liberal licenses such as BSD or Public Domain.  These licenses are noted in the files.

Our beautiful icons (edit, info, map, talk) contributed by Erik Anderson.  

The mimetype icons (in the files area) are from KDE (GPL) and have been modified.
